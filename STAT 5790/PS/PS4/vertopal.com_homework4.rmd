**Homework 4 -- Due 5 October**

The total points on this homework is 175. Out of these, 5 points are
reserved for clarity of presentation, punctuation and commenting with
respect to the code.

The homework for this week are mainly exercises in using the apply()
function, and its benefits in many cases where the problem can be
"reduced" (which may mean, expanded for some cases) to operations at the
margins of an array. Some of the problems are for a bigger dataset that
is more cumbersome to notice operations on, so you are advised to try it
out first on a small array (say of dimension 3x4x5) and then moving to
the given problem once you are confident of your approach to solving the
problem.

> 2\. *Microarray gene expression data.* The file, accessible on Canvas
> at diurnaldata.csv contains gene expression data on 22,810 genes from
> Arabidopsis plants exposed to equal periods of light and darkness in
> the diurnal cycle. Leaves were harvested at eleven time-points, at the
> start of the experiment (end of the light period) and subsequently
> after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours of darkness and light each. Note that
> there are 23 columns, with the first column representing the gene
> probeset. Columns 2--12 represent measurements on gene abundance taken
> at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours of darkness and light each, while columns
> 13-23 represent the same for a second replication.
>
> \(a\) Read in the dataset. Note that this is a big file, and can take
> a while, especially on a slow connection. \[5 points\]
>
> \(b\) For each gene, calculate the mean abundance level at each
> time-point, and store the result in a matrix. One way to achieve this
> is to create a three-dimensional array or dimension 22*,* 810 *×* 11
> *×* 2 and to use apply over it with the appropriate function and over
> the appropriate margins. Note that you are only asked present the
> commands that you use here. From now on, we will use this dataset
> averaged over the two replications for each gene. \[15 points\]
>
> \(c\) *Standardization.* Gene data are compared to each other by way
> of correlations. (Correlation between any two sequences is related, by
> means of an affine (linear) transformation, to the Euclidean distance
> between the sequences, after standardization to have mean zero and
> standard deviation 1).

> i\. In pursuance of the objective, use the apply function to calculate
> the mean of the mean abundance level over all time-points for each
> gene. \[10 points\]
>
> ii\. Set up a matrix of dimension 22*,* 810 *×* 11 of the means of the
> mean abundance levels, where each row is a replicated version of the
> first one. Use this to eliminate the mean effect from the matrix
> stored in the previous part. \[10 points\]
>
> iii\. Use the apply function again to calculate the standard deviation
> of each row of the matrix in the part (b) above, and proceed to obtain
> the scaled measurements on the genes. \[10 points\]
>
> \(d\) The file micromeans.dat contains a 20 *×* 11 matrix of
> measurements. Read in this dataset, and stan-dardize as above. \[5
> points\]
>
> \(e\) We will now identify which of these means is closest to each
> gene. To do so, set up an three-dimensional array (of dimension 22*,*
> 810*×*11*×*20) with 20 replicated datasets (of the 22,810 diurnal mean
> abundance levels over 11 time-points). Next, set up replications of
> the 20 mean vectors into a three-dimensional array (of dimension 22*,*
> 810 *×* 11 *×* 20), with the replications occurring along the first
> dimension. Using apply and the above, obtain a 22*,* 810*×*20 matrix
> of Euclidean distances for each gene and mean. Finally, obtain the
> means to which each gene is closest to. Report the frequency
> distribution, and tabulate the frequencies, and display using a
> piechart. \[25 points\]

> 3\. The United States Postal Service has had a long-term project to
> automating the recognition of handwrit-ten digits for zip codes. The
> file ziptrain.dat has data on different numbers of specimens for each
> digit. Each observation is in the form of a 256-dimensional vector of
> pixel intensities. These form a 16x16 image of pixel intensities for
> each digit. Each digit is determined to be a specimen of the actual
> digit given in the file zipdigit.dat. The objective is to clean up the
> dataset to further distinguish one digit from the other.

| > ii\. Using par(mfrow = c(40,50)) and a total image size of          |
| > 5*.*2"*×*6*.*5", image all the 2000 digits using apply and the      |

| > \(c\) We now compute the mean and standard deviation images of the  |
| > digits. To do so, we convert the array back to a matrix, and        |
| > calculate the means for the ten digits, convert back to a           |
