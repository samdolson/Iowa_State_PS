# Assignment 3

1. **(10 pt.)** Suppose that a random variable $Y$ has a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  
A standard form for the probability density function of $Y$ is, for $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$,

$$
f(y \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} 
y^{\alpha - 1} (1 - y)^{\beta - 1}, \quad 0 < y < 1.
$$

Put this density in **canonical exponential family form**.  

Using properties of exponential families, find $E\{\log(Y)\}$ and $E\{\log(1-Y)\}$ expressed in terms of the original $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters.  

*Note:* Use $\Gamma'(x)$ to denote the derivative of the gamma function,  

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\Gamma(x).
$$

2. **(5 pt.)** Suppose that a random variable $Y$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$.  
A standard form for the probability mass function of $Y$ is, for $\lambda > 0$,

$$
f(y \mid \lambda) = \frac{1}{y!} \lambda^y \exp(-\lambda), 
\quad y = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
$$

Put this probability mass function in **canonical exponential family form**.  

Using properties of exponential families, verify that $E(Y) = \lambda$.

3. Suppose that a random variable $Y$ has a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  
A standard form for the probability density function of $Y$ is, for $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$,

$$
f(y \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y^{\alpha - 1} \exp(-\beta y), \quad y > 0.
$$

*Note:* You may have seen a gamma density written with a parameter that is equal to $1/\beta$ in the above expression. Use the parameterization given above to answer this question (I think it will be easier).

**(a) (5 pts.)** Write the gamma density in the form of a two-parameter exponential family.  
Using properties of exponential families, derive the expected values of $Y$ and $\log(Y)$.

**(b) (5 pts.)** Write the gamma density in the form of an exponential dispersion family with parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$.  
Derive the expected value of $Y$.
