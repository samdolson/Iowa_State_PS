# Definitions

## Chapter 1

Four Fundamental Notions of Probability: 

(1): Laplacian Probability 

  - "Gambling"/"Classical" probability
  - E.g., fair coins, dice, cards 
  - A material concept of probability 
  - Equally likely outcomes a typical result
  - $Pr(E) \equiv \frac{|E|}{|S|}$, S sample space, E event, |A| size of set A 
  
(2): Relative Frequency

  - **"Not hypothetical limiting relative frequency"**
  - A material concept of probability 
  - Probability is a direct consequence of physical realities, particularly for finite populations 
  - $Pr(A | B) = \frac{|A|}{|B|}$, where there is a finite number of objects in class B, and operation to determine whether object also belongs to a class A. 
    
(3): Hypothetical Limiting Relative Frequency

  - "What we usually mean when we refer to relative frequency or frequentist probability" 
  - A material concept of probability 
  - Can at least hypothetically repeat operation an infinite number of times 
  - $Pr(E) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\frac{E_n}{n})$
  
(4): Epistemic Probability 

  - Any concept of probability that cannot be expressed in terms of physical events can be considered epistemic probability. 
  - Probability $\equiv$ knowledge or belief 
  - Belief is updated or modified in the light of observed information; mathematical formalism necessary for logical consistency 
  - $Pr(E | y) = \frac{Pr(y|E)Pr(E)}{Pr(y|E)Pr(E) Pr(y|E^{c})Pr(E^{c})}$

Note: (1) through (3) use same notion of "operation", "sample space", and "events" 

Operation: Observation, measurement, or selection

Sample Space: Set of possible Outcomes of an operation

Events: Subsets of elements in the sample space 

Approaches to Statistical Analysis: 

  (1): Analysis Through Randomization: Predominantly using Laplacian and Relative Frequency probability concepts 
  
  (2): Analysis Using Models: Typically uses Hypothetical Limiting Relative Frequency
  
  (3): Bayesian Analysis: Construction of data model; makes use of epistemic probability in the form of prior and posterior distributions

## Chapter 2 

Abstract: To mean abstruse; but also, to separate, to express a quality apart from an object, or to consider a part as divorced from the whole 

Experimental vs. Observational Studies: More like Experimental vs. Non-Experimental 

Experimental Approach: 

  - The *Whole*: consists of all the external conditions to which an experimental unit is subject. 
  - The *Part*: is to examine fluctuations in a small number of those conditions while holding all others constant. 
  - Key element is control of all relevant factors. 
  
Statistical Modelling: Depends entirely on the mathematical concepts of random variables and theoretical probability distributions. 

  - Def: A collection of probabilistic assignments and specified relations among model components that leads to a joint probability distribution for the entire collection of random variables involved in a problem. 

Random variables: Mathematical concepts that are attached to the results of observation pof the quantities of primary interest on sampling units. 

  - Sampling units may correspond to experimental units under that approach to analysis and may certainly be physically existing entities, but neither are required for the concepts of random variables and their assumed theoretical distributions to be valid. 
  - Random variables and theoretical probability distributions are not simply an extension of finite populations to infinite collections of physical units, if even possible; random variables are mathematical beasts. 
  
Statistical Abstraction: Capturing the key elements of a problem in a small set of parameters of a probabilistic model. 

A Linear Model: 
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \sigma \epsilon_i; \epsilon_i \sim iidN(0,1). 
$$

Systematic Model Component: $\beta_0 + \beta_1x_i$

Dispersion, variance, or precision parameter quantities the degree to which observed values differ from what is "explained" by the modeled version.": $\sigma^2$ 

Objectives of Analysis: 

  (1): Data Description
  
  (2): Problem Conceptualization
  
  (3): Examination of Scientific Theory 
  
  (4): Estimation and Inference About a Specific Quantity 
  
  (5): Prediction or Forecasting: These are two different things! 
  
Prediction: prediction of an unobserved random variable or functional of a distribution that is given (conceptualized) existence within the spatial and/or teporal extent of a set of data.

Forecasting: prediction of random quantities that are given (conceptual) existence outside the spatial and/or temporal extent of the available data. 

Distinguishing between *motivation* and *verification*

  - Motivation can be provided by elements of the scientific problem, physical realities of data collection, definitiion of random variables, or exploratory analysis of the data themselves. 
  - The observational process can motivation assumptions of independence (or lack thereof). 
  - For now we can think of verification as a goodness of fit problem.

# Reading Notes 

## Chapter 1

"Probability, no matter how it is conceptualized, obeys certain rules of behavior and, hence, mathematical results developed for probability do not depend on what exactly one believes it is." 

"Probability is **not a thing** but a **concept**." 

Question: For a given type of statistical analysis, is the "type" of probability concept you use "locked in place" throughout the analysis? 

## Chapter 2 

"A model is a set of invented assumptions regarding invested entities such that, if one treats these invented entities as representations of appropriate elements of the phenomena studied, the consequences of the hypotheses constituting the model are expected to aggree with observations." - Neyman, 1957, allegedly 

Focus of the course will be on *parametric modelling* 

"All that is needed is for the actual assignment of treatments to experimental units to be one of a set of a known number of equally likely arrangements." 

Question: XU applied to treatments vs. Treatments applied to XU? 

"The construct of weight (a covariate of a statistical model) does not depend on the particular measurement tool used to observe it, nor does it depend on a set of physically real outcomes of an observation process." 
"The majority of scientific investigations (experiments or otherwise) are based on the concept that there exists a mechanism that underlies the production of observable quantities." 

"In many, if not most areas of science, mechanisms are not fully understood." 

"The upshot of...for the purpose of statistical modeling is that scientific mechanisms or repeatable phenomena represent the key elements of a problem to be captured in a small set of model parameters...by this we do not mean a direct translation of a mechanism into mathematical terms."

"A criticism that is sometimes leveled at the modeling approach is that a model "doesn't care where the data come from", or "how the data were obtained"...however...no model can properly operate beyond the context given it by the process of statistical abstraction which, in a proper application, must have been given careful consideration." 

"Observed values of random variables" is not strictly speaking, a valid notion; what we actually mean is that "data represent possible values that might be assumed by random variables." 

"Distributions within a class share various statistical properties (which properties these are depends on which class)." 

"The major impact of generalized linear models was to promote consideration of random and systematic model components rather than signal plus noise."
