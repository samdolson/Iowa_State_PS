# Q1 

Following the solution or instructor’s comments on Part 1, take the MCMC output files provided and approximate the posterior distribution of the weight of fish at length $15$ inches for each of the $75$ lakes. Also produce $90\%$ credible intervals for the posterior mean weight. Order the posterior means small to large, and graph the posterior means along with line segments representing credible intervals with lake index on the vertical axis. An example for a hypothetical example with $5$ situations (will be our lakes) is shown in Figure 1. Your plot will have $75$ intervals going up the vertical axis (and will be unlikely to extend to $5$ on the horizontal axis). Note that you will have to re-index the lakes upon ordering the values. In real life we would want to retain a mapping from that re-indexing to the lake number of the original data so that IDNR could identify which lake is which.

## Answer 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Posterior mean expected weight of a 15-inch largemouth bass by lake, ordered from smallest to largest. Horizontal line segments show 90% credible intervals."}

# Q2 

Also take the MCMC output files and approximate, for each lake, the posterior mean of the probability that a $15$ inch large mouth bass exceeds $1.83$ pounds. Order these values and plot them on the horizontal axis against the re-indexed lakes ($1$ through $75$) on the vertical axis. This plot will look quite a bit like an empirical distribution function.

## Answer

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Posterior mean probability that a 15-inch largemouth bass exceeds 1.83 pounds, by lake. Lakes are ordered from smallest to largest."}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/samue/OneDrive/Desktop/Iowa_State_PS/STAT_6010/PS2/Plot2.png")
