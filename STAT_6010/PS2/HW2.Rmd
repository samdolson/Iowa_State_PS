# Q1

Discuss whether you believe it would be better to view this problem as one involving a Bayesian analysis of a mixture model, or as one we should approach with a model having several levels of prior distributions. *Hint: Read Assignment 2 – Background carefully before developing your answer to this question.*

## Answer 

### Direct Answer 

Because the goal is inference about *specific lakes and their health (condition) parameters*, it is better to view this problem as one with a model having several levels of prior distributions, rather than as a Bayesian mixture model.

Following the principle detailed in Chapter 15, the interpretation should be based on *what quantities are scientifically meaningful to estimate*; another way to note this distinction is whether we are more interested in the data itself (multi-level) or more interested in the data-generating mechanism (mixture). Here, the lake-specific parameters $\beta_i$ represent the health of identifiable lakes, we are interested in those particular lakes, and as such the scope of our inference is for each of these individual units (lakes).

### Added Context

#### Ch. 15 Notes

Based on the 520 text, the modelling choice between a Bayesian analysis of a mixture model vs. a model having several levels of prior distributions hinges upon *what the quantity of interest is*. 

If the goal is inference about *specific units*, such that the group parameters $\theta_i$ represent persistent, interpretable characteristics and one could plausibly observe additional data generated under the same $\theta_i$ (e.g., the same hospital, school, or lake), then treat the hierarchy as a **multi-stage prior**, with quantities: 

$$
f(y \mid \theta), \quad \pi_1(\theta \mid \lambda), \quad \pi_2(\lambda),
$$

and focus on the unit-level posteriors $p(\theta_i \mid y)$ with partial pooling. 

If instead the goal of inference is about the *population distribution of effects across groups*, i.e., the data-generating mechanism, and the observed units are best viewed as exchangeable draws from that population so that the individual $\theta_i$ are not themselves of intrinsic interest, then one should treat the model as a **mixture**, integrate out $\theta$ to obtain a posterior of the form: 

$$
f(y \mid \lambda) = \int f(y \mid \theta)\, g(\theta \mid \lambda)\, d\theta,
$$

and focus on $p(\lambda \mid y)$ or predictive distributions $p(\theta^* \mid y)$. 

#### Relevant Background Context 

As described in the background material, biologists at the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) are concerned with assessing the *health ("condition") of fish populations within specific lakes*, where condition reflects how heavy fish are for their length. Although individual fish exhibit natural variability, condition is largely determined by lake-level environmental factors. Consequently, and as explicitly noted, condition is interpreted as a *persistent lake-level characteristic*.

Importantly, the scientific objective is to evaluate the health (condition) of the *particular lakes sampled (the 75 lakes in the study)*. From a management perspective, each lake represents a meaningful unit for decision-making, and additional data could plausibly be collected from the same lake under the same underlying ecological conditions. Therefore, lake-specific parameters represent scientifically interpretable quantities of direct interest rather than nuisance or latent variables.

# Q2: 

Based on your answer to question 1, what would you include in a summary of your inferences associated with the problem. Be specific about types of summary information (e.g., five number summary or table of quantiles) and/or graphs and plots (e.g., scatterplot of $y$ versus $x$, plot of empirical distribution of $f$). Indicate how these inferences can be used to address the goals of the Iowa DNR.

## Answer 

Based on my answer to Q1, inference should focus primarily on the *lake-specific condition parameters*, $\beta_i$. These represent persistent, interpretable ecological characteristics of identifiable lakes and are the direct quantities needed for management decisions. The population-level hyperparameters $(\lambda, \tau^2)$ provide context by describing between-lake variability and enabling partial pooling, but they are secondary to the lake-level effects.

Accordingly, summaries (of inferences) should prioritize *posterior inference for each lake*, but still include *comparisons across lakes*, with population summaries and diagnostics used to contextualize summaries of inferences (though not noted below, as they are not a summary of inferences, the latter of these is important for contextualizing and assessing the reasonableness/appropriateness of results).

Together, these summaries enable the DNR to estimate condition for each lake with uncertainty, identify unusually poor or healthy lakes, understand statewide variability, and potentially predict future or unsampled lakes.

### Lake-specific summaries (primary)

The main inferential objects are the posteriors $p(\beta_i \mid y)$.

For each lake $i$, report:

- Posterior $\beta_i$ summary table, including mean, median, standard deviation, max, min, upper (75%), and lower (25%) quantiles 
- 80%, 90%, and 95% credible intervals
- Posterior probability of being below a biologically meaningful threshold (i.e., compared to some standard weight) 

$$P(\beta_i < c \mid y)$$

Some supplemental visuals include:

Tables:

- Table of posterior summaries and credible intervals for all lakes
- Ranked table (lowest to highest condition)
- Posterior ranks or probabilities of being among the worst/best lakes

Graphs:

- Caterpillar plot of $\beta_i$ with credible intervals (sorted)
- Boxplot or density of $\{\beta_i\}$ across lakes 
- (Optional, and if possible) Spatial map to identify potential lake systems grouping(s) relative to high/low condition

Goal: These summaries, tables, and graphs of the inferences would allow Iowa DNR to identify poorly conditioned lakes, potentially to target for intervention, and provide a method to both compare lakes quantitatively while incorporating (and quantifying) uncertainty about the lakes.

### Population-level summaries (secondary)

Though secondary to the lake-specific summaries of inferences, the population-level summaries are still important; the main use/utility of these summaries is to ensure that inference for $\beta_i$'s is appropriate, both biologically and statistically.

To describe statewide patterns and heterogeneity, I'd recommend reporting:

- Posterior means and 95% credible intervals for $(\lambda, \tau^2)$, to understand typical statewide condition (location $\lambda$) and lake-to-lake variability (spread $\tau^2$). 
- Density or histogram of posterior draws of $\beta_i$

### Misc: Model Assessment

Related to both the primary and secondary summaries noted above, it is also important to assess the adequacy of the model used for generating the inferences. For that reason I'm explicitly noting: To assess adequacy of the model, I would look at and report:

- Scatterplot of $Y_{i,j}$ versus $x_{i,j}$ with fitted curves:   

$$\hat{\mu}_{i,j} = \hat{\beta}_i x_{i,j}^{\hat{\alpha}}$$

- Posterior predictive checks (simulated vs observed data), taking care not to use a sufficient quantity to determine appropriateness of the simulation (likely using quantiles instead)
- Residual plots

# Q3: 

A statistical issue in the use of the hierarchical model developed in Assignment 2 – Background is the fixed value of the power $\theta = 1.0$ used in the analysis. Describe how you would conduct an assessment of this modeling choice. In particular, there are two immediate alternatives to our choice. One is that a single value of $\theta$ should be adequate to reflect data behavior, but its value should be something other than $\theta = 1.0$. In this case, we might assign a prior (similarly to $\alpha$), but this question is not about what we might choose for that prior, only how we might assess the output of analysis of the hierarchical model in files `LMBmcmc1.txt` and `LMBmcmc2.txt` and the actual data (in file `LMBdat_for601.txt`) to determine whether we are motivated to include a prior for $\theta$. 

The other possibility is that we might allow this power to have different values in different lakes, and make use of parameters $\{\theta_i : i = 1, \ldots, n\}$. These quantities would then need to be assigned a distribution, the parameters of which will be assigned a prior but, again, don’t worry about what any of those distributions might be, only how we could determine whether there is evidence that a single value of $\theta$, be that $\theta = 1$ or some other value, appears adequate or inadequate to reflect the behavior of the actual data.

## Answer

The parameter $\theta$ determines how the variance scales with the mean through

$$
\operatorname{Var}(Y_{i,j}\mid \cdot)=\sigma_i^2 \mu_{i,j}^{2\theta}
$$

Thus, fixing $\theta=1$ imposes a specific mean–variance relationship, i.e., imposes variance is proportional to $\mu_{i,j}^2$. To assess whether this assumption is adequate, I would evaluate whether this scaling produces approximately homoscedastic, Gaussian residuals and whether the data suggest a different or heterogeneous exponent.

Using the posterior output from the existing hierarchical fit together with the observed data, I would proceed in three steps.

### 1. Residual diagnostics under $\theta=1$

Compute standardized residuals

$$
r_{i,j}^{(1)}=\frac{y_{i,j}-\mu_{i,j}}{\sigma_i \mu_{i,j}},
$$

which should resemble iid $N(0,1)$ if the variance scaling is correct. I would examine:

- residuals versus fitted means $\mu_{i,j}$ to check for remaining heteroscedasticity,
- absolute residuals versus $\mu_{i,j}$ to detect systematic changes in spread,
- normal Q–Q plots to assess departures from Gaussianity.

If $\theta=1$ is appropriate, these plots should show no systematic patterns and roughly constant variance.

### 2. Estimating a common exponent.

To assess whether a single value of $\theta$ other than $1$ is more appropriate, I would exploit the implied relationship

$$
\log\!\left(\frac{(y_{i,j}-\mu_{i,j})^2}{\sigma_i^2}\right)
= c + 2\theta \log(\mu_{i,j}) + \varepsilon.
$$

A regression of the log residual variance on $\log(\mu_{i,j})$ provides an estimate of $2\theta$. If this estimated slope differs substantially from $2$, this would indicate that a common $\theta \neq 1$ better describes the data, motivating inclusion of $\theta$ as an unknown parameter with a prior.

### 3. Assessing lake-specific heterogeneity.
To determine whether the scaling differs across lakes, I would repeat the same regression separately for each lake to obtain lake-specific estimates $\theta_i$. If these estimates are similar across lakes, a single common $\theta$ is adequate. If they vary widely or show systematic differences, this would suggest modeling $\{\theta_i\}$ hierarchically.

### Decision criteria

- If residuals appear homoscedastic and the estimated slope is close to $2$, then $\theta=1$ is adequate.
- If residuals show systematic mean–variance patterns and the estimated slope differs from $2$, then we have reason to estimate a single unknown $\theta$.
- If there is substantial between-lake variability in the estimated exponents, then allowing lake-specific $\theta_i$ may be justified.

Notably, the adequacy of the fixed value $\theta=1$ can be evaluated using graphical and regression-based diagnostics without specifying any additional priors in advance.
