**Directions:** Type or clearly handwrite your solutions to each of the
following exercises. Partial credit cannot be given unless all work is
shown. You may work in groups provided that each person takes
responsibility for understanding and writing out the solutions.
Additionally, you must give proper credit to your collaborators by
providing their names on the line below (if you worked alone, write "No
Collaborators\"):\

1.  **\[**+10\]: Some researchers were interested in studying the
    effects of different fertilizer amount (Low Nitrogen and High
    Nitrogen) and different genotypes (one energy line and one grain
    line) of sorghum on biomass. For each genotype, six pots of
    one-week-old seedlings were available, and each pot held one
    seedling. For each genotype, the researchers randomly assigned three
    pots to high nitrogen treatment (H) and the remaining three pots to
    low nitrogen (L) treatment. After 2 weeks, the fresh weight for each
    seedling was measured. In total, there are 12 observations.

    1.  Identify the experimental units.

    2.  Identify the observational units.

    3.  Identify the treatments.

    4.  Identify the response variable.

    5.  Does the experiment utilize replication? Answer yes/no and
        provide a brief justification.

    6.  Does the experiment utilize blocking? Answer yes/no and provide
        a brief justification.

    7.  Does the experiment utilize randomization? Answer yes/no and
        provide a brief justification.

2.  **\[**+10\]: A statistics teacher wanted to determine if having
    business students use clickers to respond to questions posed in a
    business statistics class would improve student learning. The
    teacher decided to have students use clickers in one class of
    introductory business statistics 226. She did not have students use
    clickers in a second class of business statistics 226 that she
    taught during the same semester. She tossed a coin to select the
    class to use the clickers. She used the same book and the same
    lectures in both classes and gave the same assignments and same
    exams to both classes. There were 90 students in each class. At the
    end of the semester, she compared the final exam scores for the
    students in the class that used clickers to the final exam scores
    for the students in the class that did not use clickers.

    1.  Identify the experimental units.

    2.  Identify the observational units.

    3.  Identify the treatments.

    4.  Identify the response variable.

    5.  Does the experiment utilize replication? Answer yes/no and
        provide a brief justification.

    6.  Does the experiment utilize blocking? Answer yes/no and provide
        a brief justification.

    7.  Does the experiment utilize randomization? Answer yes/no and
        provide a brief justification.

3.  **\[**+30\]: The file `guinea_pigs.csv` (available on Canvas)
    contains data on survival times (in days) of guinea pigs that were
    randomly assigned either to a control group or to a treatment group
    that received a dose of tubercle bacilli (Doksum, K. (1974), *Annals
    of Statistics*, pp 267-77).

    1.  Use R to compute the following summary statistics for each
        treatment group:

        ::: center
          Statistic             $\qquad$ Control $\qquad$   $\qquad$ Bacilli $\qquad$
          -------------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------
          Median                                           
                                                           
          Q1                                               
                                                           
          Q3                                               
                                                           
          IQR                                              
                                                           
          Sample Mean                                      
                                                           
          Standard Deviation                               
                                                           
        :::

    2.  Use R to construct side-by-side box plots of survival times for
        the two treatment groups and include it with this assignment.

    3.  Use the box plots from part (b) and the summary statistics from
        part (a) to describe and compare features of the distributions
        of survival times for the two treatment groups.

    4.  There is no function built into R to easily perform the
        randomization test to determine whether the average survival
        times of the guinea pigs in the two treatment groups is the same
        or different. Write your own function to perform the test (there
        is an example in the optional R lab). Interpret the results by
        providing

        1.  the null and alternative hypotheses;

        2.  observed test statistic;

        3.  randomization histogram;

        4.  p-value;

        5.  interpretation of the test results (stated in the context of
            the problem).
