**[Introduction to Confidence Intervals in SAS]{.underline}**

The same SAS code that conducts the two-sample t-test in SAS will also
provide a corresponding confidence interval. As an example, consider the
observational study on texting speeds from last time:

For a school statistics poster competition in 2006, students timed 15
randomly selected teenagers from the school and 15 randomly selected
staff from the school over the age of 30 on how long it took each person
to text the following sentence on their phone: "the quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog.\" Each subject had the sentence in front of
them while they were typing. The text message had to be typed with no
errors, no abbreviations, and no use of the phone directory. Time was
measured using a stop watch to within 0.01 seconds. Participants were
timed using two phones - their own phone and a "control\" phone, which
was the same for all participants. We would like to determine if
teenagers were faster "texters,\" on average, than adults. The data are
located in the `smsspeed.csv` file and the full SAS program in
`smsspeed_Lab3.sas` within our course's shared folder in SAS Studio.

-   First, load in the dataset:

            data SMS;
                 infile `~/my_shared_file_links/u63538023/STAT5000_Fall2024_ISU/
                         smsspeed.csv' dlm=`,' firstobs=2;
                 input Age AgeGroup $ Own Control;
            run;

-   Then, use the `proc ttest` command to conduct a test and obtain the
    corresponding confidence interval for the difference in mean speed
    between the teenagers and adults. Use the `class` option to specify
    the category variable and the `var` option to specify the response
    variable.

            title1 `T-test for Difference in Mean Times - Own Phone';
            proc ttest data=SMS; 
                 class AgeGroup;
                 var Own;
            run;

    You'll find the corresponding 95% confidence interval in the columns
    of the output table for `95% CL Mean` and then look at the row for
    `Diff (1-2) Pooled`.

-   You can change the confidence level using the `alpha=` parameter.
    For example, a 99% confidence interval can be obtained by:

            proc ttest data=SMS alpha=0.01; 
                 class AgeGroup;
                 var Own;
            run;

**[Sample Size Simulations in SAS]{.underline}**

In lecture, we looked at an example of a randomized experiment to
determine which of two treatments was the most effective at reducing
bone loss in elderly women. In this experiment, we will assume equal
sample sizes, equal population variances, and normally distributed
response variables in both samples. We will also assume an estimate of
the pooled sample variance for the response variable is available from
previous studies, denoted as $S_p^2$. The SAS code to calculate sample
sizes is provided in the `power_Lab3.sas` file in the course's shared
folder in SAS Studio.

-   Suppose our research question is to determine whether or not the two
    treatment means are different. We will use a hypothesis test with
    Type I error rate of $\alpha$ and will want the power to detect a
    difference of $\delta$ units between the treatment means to be
    $1-\beta$.

    In lecture, our example used $\alpha=0.05$ (`alpha`), $1-\beta=0.8$
    (`power`), $\delta=4$ (`meandiff`), and $S_p^2=25$ (take the square
    root and enter as `stddev`). The code that produced the result of
    $26$ subjects in each treatment group (specified using a period for
    `npergroup`, meaning this is what you want SAS to solve for) is
    given below.

                proc power;
                     twosamplemeans test=diff
                     alpha = 0.05
                     meandiff = 4.0
                     stddev= 5
                     npergroup = .
                     power = 0.80;
                run;

-   Then, use SAS to help you determine the effect of changes to the
    values of $\alpha$, $1-\beta$, $\delta$, and $S_p^2$ on the sample
    size ($n$). To make it easier to study these changes, you can modify
    the SAS code to study the sample size for multiple values of an
    input value at the same time. For example, to study the effect of
    increasing power $1-\beta$, you can change the power command to

                     power = 0.80 to 0.95 by 0.05;

    or you can list values to study, like

                     power = 0.80, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99;

-   Instead of the analysis above, suppose our research question is to
    estimate the difference between the two treatment means using a
    $100(1-\alpha)$% confidence with width of no more than $\delta$
    units.

    In lecture, our example used $\alpha=0.05$, $\delta=4$, and
    $S_p^2=25$. From the calculation, we obtained a sample size of $50$
    from each sample. The code that produced this result is given below.

            proc power; 
                 twosamplemeans test=diff
                 alpha = 0.05
                 meandiff = 4.0
                 stddev= 5
                 npergroup = .
                 power = 0.975;
            run;

    Note: For sample size determinations using the confidence interval
    method, the value of `power` should always be set to the confidence
    level, $1-(\alpha/2)$.
