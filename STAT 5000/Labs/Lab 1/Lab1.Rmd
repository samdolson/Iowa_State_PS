## Q: 1.  Calculate the sample mean score for each treatment group. What is the difference in the two sample means?

### A: 

```{r Means, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sample Means by Intrinsic/Extrinsic", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("sampleMeans.png")
```

Sample mean for extrinsic: $\approx{15.7391}$

Sample mean for intrinsic: $\approx{19.8875}$

Difference in sample means: $\text{Intrinsic Mean - Extrinsic Mean} = 19.888 - 15.739 = 4.1484$

\pagebreak

## Q: 2.  Use SAS to create a comparative box-plot for the sample mean score for each treatment group. Describe what you see.

### A: 

```{r BoxplotSamples, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Boxplot of Samples by Treatment Type", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("boxPlotSample.png")
```

Broadly speaking, we see that the scores of the intrinsic group tend to be larger than the scores of the extrinsic group. The first quartile, mean, and third quartile are all comparatively higher values than their corresponding statistic in the extrinsic group. We see from the above box and whisker plots that the IQR of the intrinsic group is roughly equal to or greater than the upper quartile of the extrinsic group (the values of the box from the mean to Q3 of extrinsic are values that are contained in Q1 to the mean of the intrinsic group).

## Q: 3.  What are the null and alternative hypotheses for the randomization test necessary to explore the research question?

### A: 

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the average instrinic score and the average extrinsic score, with the alternate hypothesis being that the difference between the average scores in each group is not zero. We denote this as $H_0: \mu_{intrinsic} = \mu_{extrinsic}$, with $H_A: \mu_{intrinsic} \neq \mu_{extrinsic}$, where $\mu_{intrinsic}$ is the average score for study participants receiving the intrinsic treatment and similarly $\mu_{extrinsic}$ is the average score for study participants receiving the extrinsic treatment. 

\pagebreak

## Q: 4.  Conduct a randomization test for these data in SAS (be sure to keep the random seed set at 500 so everyone gets the same answer) and study the reference distribution for the difference in the sample means for the 10,000 random assignments of treatments to subjects. Describe the shape, center and variability of this distribution.

### A: 

```{r permTest, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Permutation Test Results", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("PermTest.png")
```

The shape of the above distribution is approximately normal centered at 0. There appears to be near zero in both skewness and kurtosis as well, and symmetric variance about the center (roughly equal number of values greater than 0 as there are values less than 0); the distribution also resembles the standard normal distribution. However, as no statistics were calculated on the distribution of differences, I don't feel comfortable describing the "mean" or "variance" of the above distribution. 

\pagebreak

## Q: 5.  Locate the observed difference in the sample means from part (a) on the reference distribution. Given the observed difference in the sample means from part (a), what is the p-value for this randomization test?

### A: 

```{r differences, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Table of Results as Extreme as Observed", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("DifferencesasExtremeTable.png")
```

There were $45$ results as extreme as the observed value in the study (from the total 10,000 studies simulated during the permutation test). This gives us the following (one-sided) p-value calculation: 

$\text{p-value} = \frac{\text{simulated results as Extreme as observed}}{total simulated observations} = \frac{45}{10,000} = 0.0045$

\pagebreak

6.  Interpret the results of the test in the context of the research question.

### A: 

Having a p-value of 0.0045 means that we calculate the probability that randomization alone leads to a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed in the study (of the mean score of intrinsic group being 4.1484 higher than the mean score of the extrinsic group) is 0.0045, or slightly less than half of one percent. Thus, we saw evidence that there is a treatment effect between the intrinsic and extrinsic treatment, which in turn lends support to the belief that receiving the intrinsic treatment during the study contributed to an average increase in the score (of the haiku). 

\pagebreak

## Q: 7.  What aspects of the data collection in this experiment would need special attention by the researcher?
    
### A: 

Primarily I would want the researcher to be certain of the exchangeability of the data, as it would be vital to the appropriateness of the randomization test (permutation) done above. If in some way the independence of observations was not assured then the researcher may be led to false conclusions (certainly related to and impacted by the additional notes given below!)

#### Some additional asides 

Of particular note: Researchers should be especially weary of generalizing and applying the results of this study to a broader population of interest. I also have concerns (and project those concerns to the researcher) with regards to the selection of participants for the study. Specifically: Though participants are all "creative writers", there are many different ways in which one can be a "creative writer", and we would want to ensure our sample is representative of all possible (or typical) creative writers as well as having that representation within each treatment group. 

I am also concerned about how the scores were generated: Though the scores are being generated from non-participants in the study (*"12 poets then scored
these poems on a 40-point scale based on the creativity shown in the writing"*, meaning the score of a participant is the average score given by the poets), the score is given as a composite of multiple scores. This leads inevitably to some fuzziness. 

There are two points I want to illustrate with this, one being the meaning of a score and the second being the potential variability of scores for an individual participant. First, what's the difference between a 14 and a 15? Is that difference the same as the difference between a 16 and a 17? Poets grade on a 40-point scale based on the creativity of a haiku, but how consistent is that scoring, and how vague are the underlying scoring criteria? Secondly, since we are using the mean value of the scores of an individual, these average scores can be dramatically affected by outliers. By comparison the median score would not be as affected by outliers, i.e. if there was one particular poet who tended to score participants especially low or high, then the overall distribution would be biased (not using the technical definition) by that one judge. This means if a participant was scored $\{ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 38\}$, they would have mean score 5 and median score 2. As a researcher I would want to at least be aware of this possibility and think through if the mean score is the proper metric of the data to collect.
