turn in any required files online in Canvas, then check-in with the Lab
TA for dismissal.\

**[Introduction to t-Tests in R]{.underline}**

Refer to the `fuel_economy.csv` data file posted in Canvas. This data
set has information about an observational study of automobiles driven
in Canada, including the following two columns:

`Cylinders`:

:   category variable with two levels - 4 or 6

`Consumption`:

:   numeric response variable with the fuel consumption in miles per
    gallon (mpg)

Researchers are interested in exploring whether there is a difference in
the average fuel consumption of vehicles with engines built using
differing numbers of cylinders. The code to conduct a two-sample t-test
in R is explained below. The full R program is provided in the file
`fuel_economy_Lab2.R` posted on Canvas.

-   First, load in the data using the *Import Dataset* tool in R Studio.
    Be sure to change the variable type on the Cylinders column to
    "factor\" and enter "4, 6\" as the levels.

                library(readr)
                fuel <- read_csv("fuel_economy.csv", 
                                      col_types=cols(Cylinders=col_factor(levels=c("4", "6"))))
                View(fuel)

-   Next, compute the corresponding summary statistics within in group.

                library(tidyverse)
                sum_stats = fuel |> 
                    group_by(Cylinders) |>
                    summarize(
                        Y_n = n(),
                        Y_mean = mean(Consumption.mpg),
                        Y_sd = sd(Consumption.mpg)
                    )
                sum_stats

-   Then, use the `t.test()` function to conduct a test for the
    difference in mean fuel consumption between 4 and 6 cylinder
    vehicles. Indicate the response variable name before the $\sim$ and
    the category variable name after, use the `data` option to provide
    the name of the dataset, and use the `var.equal` option set to
    "TRUE\" to indicate the population variances are assumed equal.

                HT = t.test(Consumption.mpg~Cylinders, data=fuel, var.equal=TRUE)
                HT

    You can see what pieces of information are stored in the `HT`
    variable using the `names()` function. You can access these pieces
    of information using the `$` operator, e.g.

                names(HT)
                HT$null.value

**[Assignment]{.underline}**

1.  State the hypotheses for the two-sided test.

2.  From the output, find/compute the difference in the two sample
    means.

3.  From the output, find/compute the estimate of the pooled standard
    deviation.

4.  From the output, find/compute the test statistic for the hypothesis
    test.

5.  From the output, find/compute the degrees of freedom for the test.

6.  From the output, find/compute the $p$-value for the two-sided
    hypothesis test.

7.  Interpret the results of the two-sided test in the context of the
    research question.

8.  By default, R conducts the two-sided hypothesis test. You can change
    this by adding the parameter "`alternative=greater`" or
    "`alternative=less`" inside the `t.test()` function. Provide a
    research question corresponding to either the "greater\" or "less\"
    one-sided test.
