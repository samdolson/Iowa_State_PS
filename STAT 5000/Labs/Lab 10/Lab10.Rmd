# Clarifications

  - Q1 (d): Interpretation of significance, does it require note of the other explanatory variables? 
  - Q2 (c): Partial F-test or overall; if partial, how do you get the p-value 
  - Q3 (b): Same question as Q1 (d) 
  - Anything additional for us to add aside from overall model summary comparisons? 

# Q1 

Use SAS to run the multiple linear regression model for cityCO2 with Engine, Cylinder, and CityMPG as explanatory variables. Use the output to complete the following exercises.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="CocoMelon", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("m1.png")
```

\newpage

## (a) 

Give the equation for predicting the cityCO2 values from the three explanatory variables

$$
\hat{Y_i} = b_0 + b_1x_{(i, engine)} + b_2x_{(i, cylinder)} + b_3x_{(i, cityMP{G})}
$$

$$
\hat{Y_i} = 635.54671 + 10.80x_{(i, engine)} + 16.94x_{(i, cylinder)} - 14.66x_{(i, cityMPG)}
$$

## (b) 

Conduct an F-test for the overall model in helping to explain the cityCO2 values. Report the null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic and p-value, and interpret the result in the context of the study.

F-statistic: 965.91
p-value: < 0.0001

$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$
$H_A: \text{at least one } \beta_i \neq 0 \text{ for i = 1, 2, 3}$

Interpretation: We have overwhelming evidence to reject the null hypothesis (at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level in particular) in favor of evidence of the alternative hypothesis that at least one of our explantatory variables is significantly different from zero. Said differently, there is evidence that at least one of the following variables is statistically significant in predicting the mean C02 emissions of vehicles in city driving: Engine displacement, number of cylinders, and Fuel economy in city driving. 

## (c) 

Give the value of $R^2$ for this model and interpret its value (in context).

$R^2 = 0.9366$, or 93.66% of variability in the response variable (C02 emissions) can be explained by the multiple linear regression model using Engine displacement, number of cylinders, and Fuel economy as explanatory variables. 

## (d) 

Conduct a t-test for the significance of Engine in the model that includes Cylinder and CityMPG. Report the null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic and p-value, and interpret the result in the context of the study.

t-statistic: 2.42
p-value: 0.0166 

$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \text{ or } \beta_{Engine} = 0$
$H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0 \text{ or } \beta_{Engine} = 0$

Where the slope parameter for the Engine explanatory variable corresponds to the index value 1 in our model. 

Interpretation: We have evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the $\alpha  = 0.05$ level, such that we have evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the slope parameter for the Engine explanatory variable (displacement of the engine in liters) is not equal to zero.

# Q2 

Use SAS to run the multiple linear regression model for cityCO2 with Engine, Cylinder, CityMPG, and Gears as explanatory variables. Use the output to complete the following exercises.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="CocoMelon", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("m2.png")
```

\newpage

## (a) 

How much does adding Gears to the multiple linear regression model with Engine, Cylinder, and CityMPG reduce the sums of squared errors?

$$
SS_{error, model 1} = 173480
$$

$$
SS_{error, model 2} = 164229
$$

Difference: $SS_{error, model 1} - SS_{error, model 2}$ = 173480 - 164229 = 9251

Sum of Squared errors is reduced by 9251 by adding the Gears explanatory variable to the prior model. 

## (b) 

How much does adding Gears to the multiple linear regression model with Engine, Cylinder, and CityMPG increase the value of $R^2$?

$$
R^2_{model 1} = 0.9366
$$

$$
R^2_{model 2} = 0.94
$$

Difference: $SS_{error, model 2} - SS_{error, model 1}$ = 0.94 - 0.9366 = 0.0034

$R^2$ increases by 0.0034, or we add an additional 0.34% of variability being explained. 

## (c) 

Conduct an F-test for the effect of adding Gears to the multiple linear regression model with Engine, Cylinder, and CityMPG. Report the null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic and p-value, and interpret the result in the context of the study.


By adding 1 explanatory variable to the model, our F-statistic is: 

$$
F = \frac{(SSE_{reduced} - SSE_{full}) / m }{MSE_{full}} = ((173480 - 164229) / 1) / 842.20144 = 10.98431
$$

F-statistic: 10.98431
p-value: 

$H_0: \beta_{Gears} = 0$ 
$H_A: \beta_{Gears} \neq 0$

# Q3 

Use SAS to run the multiple linear regression model for cityCO2 with Engine, Cylinder, CityMPG, Gears, and Intake as explanatory variables. Use the output to complete the following exercises.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="CocoMelon", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("m3.png")
```

\newpage

## (a) 

Give the equation for predicting the cityCO2 values from the four explanatory variables for vehicles with two intake valves per cylinder and for vehicles that do not have two intake valves per cylinder. What is the difference in these two equations?

With 2 exhaust vales per cylinder:

$$
\hat{Y_i} = b_0 + b_1x_{(i, engine)} + b_2x_{(i, cylinder)} + b_3x_{(i, cityMP{G})} + b_4x_{(i, Gears)} + b_4x_+{(i, Intake)}
$$

$$
\hat{Y_i} = 704.967 + 1.3773x_{(i, engine)} + 22.3167x_{(i, cylinder)} -15.3258x_{(i, cityMPG)} - 5.48x_{(i, Gears)} - 22.609
$$

$$
\hat{Y_i} = 682.358 + 1.3773x_{(i, engine)} + 22.3167x_{(i, cylinder)} -15.3258x_{(i, cityMPG)} - 5.48x_{(i, Gears)}
$$

Without 2 exhaust vales per cylinder:

$$
\hat{Y_i} = b_0 + b_1x_{(i, engine)} + b_2x_{(i, cylinder)} + b_3x_{(i, cityMP{G})} + b_4x_{(i, Gears)}
$$

$$
\hat{Y_i} = 704.967 + 1.3773x_{(i, engine)} + 22.3167x_{(i, cylinder)} -15.3258x_{(i, cityMPG)} - 5.48x_{(i, Gears)}
$$

The difference between these two equations is the intercept term, or the predicted mean C02 emissions when we have 0 input for all the other explanatory variables. 

## (b) 

Conduct a t-test for the significance of Intake in the model that includes Engine, Cylinder, CityMPG, and Gears. Report the null and alternative hypotheses, test statistic and p-value, and interpret the result in the context of the study

t-statistic: -2.22
p-value: 0.0275

$H_0: \beta_{Intake} = 0$ 
$H_A: \beta_{Intake} \neq 0$ 

Interpretation: We have evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the $\alpha  = 0.05$ level, such that we have evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the slope parameter for the Intake explanatory variable (having 2 exhaust valves per cylinder) is not equal to zero.

# Q4 

How do the 3 MLR models compare?

Overall: Model 3 performs best in terms of SSE, MSE, \( R^2 \), and Adjusted \( R^2 \). Additionally, while all models have consistently significant variables (e.g., cityMPG, cylinder), the significance of engine diminishes as more variables are included, suggesting potential collinearity or redundancy. And finally, adding variables improves the fit (lower SSE, higher \( R^2 \)), but the contribution diminishes with each additional variable, as reflected in Adjusted \( R^2 \). 

Specific notes are included below: 

## Comparing Model Summary Statistics: 

### SSE (Sum of Squares for Error)

  1. Model 1 SSE = 173480
  2. Model 2 SSE = 164229
  3. Model 3 SSE = 160158

SSE decreases as we add more explanatory variables, indicating that the additional variables help explain more variation in the dependent variable (cityCO2).

### MSE (Mean Square Error)

  1. Model 1 MSE = 885.10
  2. Model 2 MSE = 842.20
  3. Model 3 MSE = 825.56

MSE also decreases with additional variables, reflecting better model fit as more predictors are included.

### $R^2$ 

  1. Model 1 \( R^2 = 0.9366 \)
  2. Model 2 \( R^2 = 0.9400 \)
  3. Model 3 \( R^2 = 0.9415 \)

$R^2$ increases as more predictors are added, though this is expected, which is why we then turn to...

### Adjusted $R^2$

  1. Model 1 Adj. \( R^2 = 0.9357 \)
  2. Model 2 Adj. \( R^2 = 0.9388 \)
  3. Model 3 Adj. \( R^2 = 0.9400 \)

Adjusted $R^2$ also increases for each successive model, but at a slower rate than $R^2$, as we penalize the additional of new explanatory variables. However, Model 3 nonetheless has the highest adjusted $R^2$ across the models considered. 

#### Consistently Significant Explanatory Variables:
Interpretation of the Intercept does not provide an especially compelling research interpretation and as such is not considered. That being said: 

  - cityMPG Significant (\( p < 0.0001 \)) in all models.
  - cylinder Significant (\( p < 0.0001 \)) in all models.

#### Changes in Significance:

Engine Explanatory Variable 
  - Model 1 Significant (\( p = 0.0166 \))
  - Model 2 Marginally insignificant (\( p = 0.0807 \))
  - Model 3 Insignificant (\( p = 0.7943 \))
  
Gears Explanatory Variable
  - Not included in Model 1.
  - Significant (\( p = 0.0011 \)) in Model 2.
  - Significant (\( p = 0.0009 \)) in Model 3.
  
Intake Explanatory variable
  - Not included in Models 1 and 2.
  - Significant (\( p = 0.0275 \)) in Model 3.
