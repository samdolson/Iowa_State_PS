# Synopsis of Paper

-   Testing the mutual independence for high-dimensional data.
-   Known that $L_2$-type statistics have lower power under sparse alternatives in high dimensions
-   Also known that $L_\infty$-type statistics have lower power under dense alternatives in high dimensions
-   Goal: Develop an adaptive test based on Kendall’s $\tau$ to work well in both situations
-   In developing an adaptive test, determine necessary assumptions and the asymptotic null distribution of the proposed statistic
-   Assess how well the test does compared to other testing methods
-   Results indicate the adaptive test performs well in either dense or sparse cases

# What is Kendall's $\tau$

$$
\tau = \frac{(\text{Count of concordant pairs}) - (\text{Count of discordant pairs})}{(\text{Number of pairs})}
$$

-   Note: Any pair of observations $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$, where i \< j, are said to be *concordant* if the sort order of $(x_i, x_j)$ and $(y_i, y_j)$ agrees
-   That is, if either both $x_i > x_j$ and $y_i > y_j$ holds or both $x_i < x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$; otherwise they are said to be *discordant*.
-   There are other types of Kendall's $\tau$, e.g., $\tau_a$, $\tau_b$, and $\tau_c$

# How Does This Fit Into a Broader Narrative?

-   **1897** — [@Fechner1897] introduces the *method of signs* for succession-dependence.
-   **1938** — [@Kendall1938] develops the $\tau$ rank correlation coefficient.
-   **1958** — [@Kruskal1958] broadens Kendall’s ideas into a general nonparametric testing framework.
-   **1958–1990s** — Others apply rank-based methods to time series [@ElShaarawi1992; @Hamed2011].
-   **2024** — [@Shi2024], the focus of this presentation, develop adaptive high-dimensional independence tests using Kendall’s $\tau$.
-   **2025** — [@Han2025] extend to a broader class of sum-of-powers tests.

<!-- # General Summary {.allowframebreaks} -->

<!-- In *Kollektivmasslehre* [@Fechner1897] created a "precursor" to Kendall’s $\tau$. His method of signs looked for consecutive-dependence in sequences of observations: Assess concordance and discordance using only the signs of differences, not their magnitudes. -->

<!-- Kendall [@Kendall1938] generalized Fechner’s idea by considering all possible pairs of observations, not just consecutive ones. His $\tau$ statistic became the canonical rank correlation coefficient, widely adopted as a nonparametric alternative to Pearson’s correlation. -->

<!-- Kruskal [@Kruskal1958] emphasized $\tau$’s place within a broader family of nonparametric statistics for ordinal data, within the framework of formal hypothesis testing.  -->

<!-- Rank-based measures then spread to time series, enabling tests for persistence/independence in various settings [@ElShaarawi1992; @Hamed2011]. -->

<!-- And now, we apply these methods (use Kendall’s $\tau$) for the purposes of robust, distribution-free procedures, assessing both how and under what circumstances these tests of independence may be applied (e.g., whether the type of data or problem would lend itself to such an application) [@Shi2024; @Han2025]. -->

<!-- # Why This, and Why Now?  -->

<!-- Modern work continues to exploit distribution-free, rank-based tests of independence: -->

<!-- Adaptive high-dimensional tests building on Kendall’s $\tau$ [@Shi2024; @Han2025]. -->

<!-- Time-series applications echoing Fechner’s focus [@ElShaarawi1992]. -->

<!-- Broader treatments of ordinal association and nonparametric effects [@Kruskal1958; @Newson]. -->

<!-- Persistence testing with ranks in environmental contexts [@Hamed2011]. -->

# In Detail: Shi et al. (2024): Problem Statement

$$
H_0: X_1, \dots, X_d \text{ are mutually independent}
$$

Testing full independence in **high dimensions** ($d \gg n$), where both *dense* and *sparse* alternatives may occur.

# Why Kendall’s $\tau$?

-   **Rank-based**, **distribution-free**, and robust to **heavy tails**.\
-   Works even when moments (e.g., variances) are infinite.\
-   Avoids dependence on the data-generation process—no parametric assumptions.\
-   Each $\tau_{k\ell}$ measures pairwise monotonic dependence between $X_k, X_\ell$.

# How Is This Non-Parametric?

-   We make no distributional assumptions of the variables (covariates or otherwise) we wish to test for independence.
-   Doesn't mean the statistic (Kendall $\tau$) is distribution-free though! Just the inputs going into it!

# Dense vs. Sparse Settings

| Setting    | Dependence Structure    | Suitable Statistic         |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Dense**  | Many weak correlations  | $L_2$-type (sum-type)      |
| **Sparse** | Few strong correlations | $L_\infty$-type (max-type) |

# Method (Overview) {.allowframebreaks}

1.  Compute pairwise Kendall’s taus $\tau_{k\ell}$.\
2.  Construct two base statistics:

-   $S_\tau$ ($L_2$-type):

$$
S_\tau = \omega_2^{-1/2}\!\left(\sum_{k>\ell}\tau_{k\ell}^2 - \tfrac{d(d-1)}{2}\omega_1\right)
\Rightarrow S_\tau \overset{d}{\to} N(0,1)
$$

-   $M_\tau$ ($L_\infty$-type):

$$
M_\tau = \omega_1^{-1}\max_{k<\ell}\tau_{k\ell}^2 - 4\ln d + \ln\ln d
\Rightarrow M_\tau \overset{d}{\to} \text{Gumbel}
$$

Where $\omega_1, \omega_2$ are constants reflecting the variance structure of pairwise Kendall's $\tau$'s under independence.

3.  Combine the two via the *minimum p-value approach* (an "adaptive test"):

$$
C_\tau = \min\{1 - \Phi(S_\tau),\, 1 - F_{\mathrm{Gumbel}}(M_\tau)\}
$$

What is an Adaptive Test?

-   A single procedure that **automatically adapts** to the dependence pattern.\
-   If data are **dense**, $S_\tau$ dominates; if **sparse**, $M_\tau$ dominates.\
-   $C_\tau$ effectively selects the stronger signal through $p\text{-value} = \min(p_{S_\tau}, p_{M_\tau})$.

# Theoretical Results I

With all the following base assumptions:

-   Finite 8th moment (for asymptotic normality of $\tau$ to hold)
-   Dependence boundedness conditions ($\alpha$-mixing type)
-   $\frac{d}{n} \rightarrow \infty$ allowed

Then, **Under** $H_0$:

-   $S_\tau$ and $M_\tau$ are **asymptotically independent** — key innovation.
-   Therefore,

$$
(S_\tau, M_\tau) \xrightarrow{d} (Z_1, Z_2)
\quad \text{with } Z_1\sim N(0,1),\; Z_2\sim \text{Gumbel}.
$$

# Theoretical Results II

-   Consequently,

$$
C_\tau = \min\{1 - \Phi(Z_1),\, 1 - F(Z_2)\} \xrightarrow{d} W=\min(U_1,U_2),
$$

where $U_1,U_2\sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$.

$$
\Rightarrow H(t) = 2t - t^2,\quad t\in[0,1].
$$

**Decision rule:**\
Reject $H_0$ if $C_\tau < 1 - \sqrt{1 - \alpha}$.

# Practical Implementation

-   Two variants:
    -   $TC_\tau$: uses theoretical (asymptotic) critical values.\
    -   $MC_\tau$: uses Monte Carlo–simulated critical values (finite-sample accurate).\
-   Distribution-free; efficient table lookup possible for $(n,d)$.

# Key Properties of the Adaptive Test

-   Joint Asymptotic independence of $S_{\tau}, M_{\tau}$ allows for an adaptive combination (hence the valid statistical test of independence)
-   **Distribution-free:** No parametric or moment assumptions.\
-   **Robust:** Handles heavy-tailed or non-Gaussian data.\
-   **Adaptive:** Unified test for both dense and sparse dependence.\
-   **Asymptotic theory:**
    -   $S_\tau \to N(0,1)$\
    -   $M_\tau \to \text{Gumbel}$\
    -   $S_\tau, M_\tau$ independent\
    -   $C_\tau \to W$ with $H(t) = 2t - t^2$

# Results I

Under various settings, we compare the following methods:

-   $S_r$: Pearson–correlation $L_2$-type test; best for *dense dependence*.

-   $TS_{\tau}$: Kendall’s tau $L_2$-type test using *asymptotic* critical values.

-   $MS_{\tau}$: Same as $TS_{\tau}$ but with *Monte Carlo* critical values.

-   $M_r$: Pearson–correlation $L_{\infty}$-type test; best for *sparse dependence*.

-   $TM_{\tau}$: Kendall’s tau $L_{\infty}$-type test using *asymptotic* Gumbel limits.

-   $MM_{\tau}$: Same as $TM_{\tau}$ but with *Monte Carlo* critical values.

-   $TC_{\tau}$: *Adaptive* Kendall’s tau test combining $S_{\tau}$ and $M_{\tau}$ (asymptotic).

-   $MC_{\tau}$: *Adaptive* Kendall’s tau test combining $S_{\tau}$ and $M_{\tau}$ (Monte Carlo).

-   $PE_r$: *Power-enhanced* Pearson test improving $S_r$ under sparse cases.

-   $U_{\min}$: *Adaptive U-statistic* test combining multiple orders via minimum p-value.

# Results II

There are a number of tables for the various conditions the author's tested the statistical tests. The main focus is on the *Size* and *Power* (mainly the latter) of the statistical tests.

Overall:

-   While one particular non-adaptive test may do best under a particular setting (dense/sparse),
-   Both implementations of the adaptive test proposed does as good (is roughly as powerful) as the "best" method, but for **both** settings
-   Highlighted portions of the tables that follow are the adaptive tests

# Applications

-   The paper also applies the method to two "real-world" examples:
    -   **Welding (4 vars, n=40):** rank-based rejects null hypothesis; Pearson fails to reject.
    -   **Biochemical (8 vars, n=12):** adaptive detects group differences.
-   I also implemented the method myself (and validated against the author's own method)
    -   Applied (mainly for fun) to a Consulting Case
    -   Apriori believed the covariate to be independent, and they were (at least according to the adaptive test)!

# Conclusion

-   Kendall’s $\tau$ connects classic nonparametric tests to modern high-dimension inference.
-   Rank-based adaptive tests are practical and robust; 2025 work generalizes to sum-of-powers [@Han2025].
-   We should consider this test when we know we have high-dimensional data, but don't know whether it is dense or sparse.
-   Allows us to test for independence beyond the typical "data collection assessment" and "variable relations graphs"
