Here is what each method represents in **Shi et al. (2024), “An adaptive test based on Kendall’s tau for independence in high dimensions”**:

---

### ( S_r )

**Pearson L₂-type test** proposed by **Schott (2005)**.
It is based on the **sum of squared off-diagonal entries** of the sample correlation matrix (i.e., a quadratic form in Pearson correlations). It performs well for **dense alternatives** where many weak dependencies exist.

---

### ( TS_{\tau} )

**Asymptotic version** of the **Kendall’s tau–based L₂-type statistic** ( S_{\tau} ).
Critical values are obtained from the **asymptotic normal distribution** rather than Monte Carlo. It tests complete independence using
[
S_{\tau} = \omega_2^{-1/2}\left( \sum_{k=2}^d \sum_{\ell=1}^{k-1} \tau_{k\ell}^2 - \tfrac{d(d-1)}{2}\omega_1 \right),
]
and is suitable for **dense dependence**.

---

### ( MS_{\tau} )

**Monte Carlo version** of the same statistic ( S_{\tau} ).
Critical values are determined empirically by Monte Carlo simulation rather than asymptotic theory. Otherwise identical to ( TS_{\tau} ).

---

### ( M_r )

**Pearson L∞-type test** proposed by **Cai and Jiang (2011)**.
It is based on the **maximum absolute off-diagonal correlation** in the sample correlation matrix. It is powerful for **sparse alternatives** where only a few strong dependencies exist.

---

### ( TM_{\tau} )

**Asymptotic version** of the **Kendall’s tau–based L∞-type statistic** ( M_{\tau} ):
[
M_{\tau} = \omega_1^{-1} \max_{k < \ell} \tau_{k\ell}^2 - 4\ln d + \ln\ln d,
]
whose null distribution follows a **Gumbel** form asymptotically. Suitable for **sparse alternatives**.

---

### ( MM_{\tau} )

**Monte Carlo version** of ( M_{\tau} ).
Critical values are obtained by simulation rather than relying on the slow-converging Gumbel approximation. Also a **Kendall’s tau–based L∞-type** statistic.

---

### ( TC_{\tau} )

**Asymptotic adaptive test** combining both ( S_{\tau} ) and ( M_{\tau} ) via
[
C_{\tau} = \min{1 - F(M_{\tau}), 1 - \Phi(S_{\tau})},
]
where ( F ) and ( \Phi ) are the CDFs of the Gumbel and normal distributions, respectively.
This version uses **theoretical asymptotic critical values**.

---

### ( MC_{\tau} )

**Monte Carlo adaptive test** version of ( C_{\tau} ).
Same form as ( C_{\tau} ) but with **simulation-based critical values**. This is the authors’ **proposed adaptive test**, automatically adjusting to **dense or sparse** dependency structures.

---

### ( PE_r )

**Power-enhanced Pearson test** from **Fan, Liao, and Yao (2015)**.
It augments the Pearson-based ( S_r ) statistic with a **power-enhancement component**, improving performance under sparse alternatives through a screening procedure.

---

### ( U_{\min} )

**Adaptive U-statistic–based test** from **He, Xu, Wu, and Pan (2021)**.
It combines p-values from multiple U-statistics of different orders via a **minimum combination rule**, analogous to ( C_{\tau} ) but based on general U-statistics rather than Kendall’s tau. Performs adaptively across sparse and dense regimes, but requires finite high-order moments.
