Suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are iid Bernoulli$(p)$, $0 < p < 1$.

## a) 

Find the information number $I_n(p)$ and make a rough sketch of $I_n(p)$ as a function of $p \in (0,1)$.

Given that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli$(p)$, the likelihood function is:

$$
L(p) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{X_i} (1 - p)^{1 - X_i}
$$

Taking the log-likelihood,

$$
log(L(p)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ X_i \log p + (1 - X_i) \log (1 - p) \right]
$$

The first derivative is:

$$
log(L(p))' = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \frac{X_i}{p} - \frac{1 - X_i}{1 - p} \right] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{X_i - p}{p(1 - p)}
$$

The Fisher information is:

$$
I_n(p) = - E \left[ log(L((p))'' \right]
$$

Computing the second derivative:

$$
log(L(p))'' = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ -\frac{X_i}{p^2} - \frac{1 - X_i}{(1 - p)^2} \right]
$$

Taking expectation:

$$
E[log(L(p))''] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ -\frac{E[X_i]}{p^2} - \frac{E[1 - X_i]}{(1 - p)^2} \right]
$$

Given we know the distribution of the random variables, we know $E[X_i] = p$ and $E[1 - X_i] = 1 - p$. This allows us to simplify the expression:

$$
E[log(L(p))''] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ -\frac{p}{p^2} - \frac{1 - p}{(1 - p)^2} \right]
= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ -\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{1 - p} \right]
= -n \left[ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{1 - p} \right]
$$

Noting linearity of Fisher information: 

$$
I_n(p) = n \left[ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{1 - p} \right]
$$

### Sketch 

```{r}
# functional form
fisher_info <- function(p, n) {
  return(n * (1/p + 1/(1 - p)))
}

# setup
p_values <- seq(0.01, 0.99, length.out = 100)
n <- 1
I_values <- fisher_info(p_values, n)

# plot
plot(x = p_values,
     y = I_values, 
     type = "l", 
     col = "black", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "p", ylab = "Fisher Information",
     main = "Fisher Information for Bernoulli(p)")
abline(v = 0.5, lty = 2, col = "gray")
```

## b) 

Find the value of $p \in (0,1)$ for which $I_n(p)$ is minimal. (This value of $p$ corresponds to the "hardest" case for estimating $p$. That is, when data are generated under this value of $p$ from the model, the variance of an UE of $p$ is potentially largest.)

To find the value of $p$ that minimizes the Fisher information $I_n(p)$, we use the functional form of the Fisher Information:

$$
I_n(p) = n \left[ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{1 - p} \right]
$$

Differentiating $I_n(p)$ with respect to $p$, and setting equal to zero:

$$
I_n(p)' = n \left[ -\frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{(1 - p)^2} \right] = -\frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{(1 - p)^2} = 0
$$

This gives us the expression:

$$
\frac{1}{p^2} = \frac{1}{(1 - p)^2}
$$

Taking square roots:

$$
\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{1 - p} \rightarrow 
p = 1 - p \rightarrow
p = \frac{1}{2}
$$

To ensure this is a maximum, we also check whether the second derivative is positive (since we are minimizing and not maximizing) at $\frac{1}{2}$:

$$
I_n(p)' = n \left[ \frac{2}{p^3} + \frac{2}{(1 - p)^3} \right]
$$

$$
I_n\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)'' = n \left[ \frac{2}{(1/2)^3} + \frac{2}{(1/2)^3} \right] = n \left[ \frac{2}{1/8} + \frac{2}{1/8} \right] = n \left[ 16 + 16 \right] = 32n > 0
$$

So this is in fact a minimum, hence the Fisher information is minimized at:

$$
p = \frac{1}{2}
$$

## c) 

Show that $\hat{X}_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i /n$ is the UMVUE of $p$.

Note to self: Uniformly Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (UMVUE)

We start by checking if $\hat{X}_n$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$:

$$
E[\hat{X}_n] = E \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right]
= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]
E[\hat{X}_n] = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n p = p
$$

$$
Bias(\bar{X_n}) = E[\hat{X}_n] - E[X] = p - p = 0 
$$

So $\hat{X}_n$ is an unbiased estimator of $p$.

Now as far as the "Uniformly Minimum Variance" part of the question: 

Note again the Fisher Information formula we've found: 

$$
I_n(p) = \frac{np}{p^2} + \frac{n(1 - p)}{(1 - p)^2} = \frac{n}{p(1 - p)}
$$

By the definition, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, for any unbiased estimator $T$ of $p$:

$$
\text{Var}_p(T) \geq \frac{(\gamma'(p))^2}{I_n(p)}
$$

Here, we are estimating $\gamma(p) = p$, so $\gamma'(p) = 1$. Therefore:

$$
\text{Var}_p(T) \geq \frac{1^2}{I_n(p)} = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}
$$

We compute the variance of $\hat{X}_n = S_n / n$:

$$
E[\hat{X}_n] = E \left[ \frac{S_n}{n} \right] = \frac{1}{n} E[S_n] = \frac{np}{n} = p
$$

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{X}_n) = \text{Var} \left( \frac{S_n}{n} \right) = \frac{1}{n^2} \text{Var}(S_n)
$$

Since $S_n \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$, we know:

$$
\text{Var}(S_n) = np(1 - p)
$$

Thus:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{X}_n) = \frac{np(1 - p)}{n^2} = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n}
$$

Comparing with the CRLB:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{X}_n) = \frac{p(1 - p)}{n} = \frac{1}{I_n(p)}
$$

Since $\hat{X}_n$ attains the bound, it is an efficient estimator.

Since $\hat{X}_n$ is unbiased and attains the CRLB, it is the UMVUE.

# 2.

Suppose that the random variables $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ satisfy

$$ Y_i = \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i, \quad i = 1, \dots, n $$

where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are fixed constants and $\varepsilon_1, \dots, \varepsilon_n$ are iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$; here we assume $\sigma^2 > 0$ is known.

## a) 

Find the MLE of $\beta$.

To find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of $\beta$, we first write the likelihood function.

Since $Y_i = \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i$ with $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, we have:

$$
Y_i \sim N(\beta x_i, \sigma^2)
$$

Thus, the joint density function of $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ is:

$$
L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{(Y_i - \beta x_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

Taking the log-likelihood:

$$
log(L(\beta)) = -\frac{n}{2} \log(2\pi\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \beta x_i)^2
$$

To find the MLE of $\beta$, we take the derivative with respect to $\beta$ and set to zero:

$$
\frac{d}{d\beta} log(L(\beta)) = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \cdot (-2) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (Y_i - \beta x_i)
= \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (Y_i - \beta x_i)
\rightarrow 
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i Y_i - \beta \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = 0
$$

Solving for $\beta$, we get our MLE of $\beta$ as::

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i Y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

To ensure this is a maximum, we take the second derivative and see if it is negative: 

$$
log(L(\beta))'' = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 < 0 
$$

So this is in fact the maximum. 

## b) 

Find the distribution of the MLE.

From part a), the MLE of $\beta$ is:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i Y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

To determine the distribution of $\hat{\beta}$, determine its expectation and variance, noting that since $\hat{\beta}$ is a linear combination of the normal random variables $\varepsilon_i$, it follows that $\hat{\beta}$ itself is normally distributed.

That being said, given $Y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$, we may write:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (\beta x_i + \varepsilon_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \frac{\beta \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \varepsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

Taking the expectation, noting our data is treated as "fixed", we may write:

$$
E[\hat{\beta}] = \frac{\beta \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i E[\varepsilon_i]}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \frac{\beta \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \beta
$$

Noting $E[\varepsilon_i] = 0$

Because $E[\hat{\beta}] = \beta$, it has zero bias and $\hat{\beta}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta$. Not needed for the distribution, but will need this note for later. 

Let us then analyze the variance. We start again with definitions: 

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}) = \text{Var}(\beta + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \varepsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}) = \text{Var}(\beta) + \text{Var}( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \varepsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2})
$$

Simplifying:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}) = \text{Var} \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \varepsilon_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} \right) = \text{Var} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(x_i^2 \sigma^2)}{(x_i^2)^2} \right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

We thus conclude:

$$
\hat{\beta} \sim N \left( \beta, \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} \right)
$$

## c) 

Find the CRLB for estimating $\beta$. (Hint: you'll have to work with the joint distribution $f(y_1, \dots, y_n | \beta)$ directly, since $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ are not iid.)

To find the CRLB, we first calculate the Fisher information.

Note the joint density: 

$$
f(Y_1, \dots, Y_n | \beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{(Y_i - \beta x_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

Taking the log-likelihood:

$$
log(L(\beta)) = -\frac{n}{2} \log(2\pi\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \beta x_i)^2
$$

We take the derivative: 

$$
log(L(\beta))' = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \cdot (-2) \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (Y_i - \beta x_i) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (Y_i - \beta x_i)
$$

The Fisher information is then:

$$
I(\beta) = -E[log(L(\beta))''] = - E\left[ -\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \right] = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2
$$ 

We then have what we need to calculate the CRLB using the information we've gathered. 

The CRLB is: 

$$
\frac{1}{I(\beta)} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} 
$$

## d) 

Show the MLE is the UMVUE of $\beta$.

Now we just need to compare the variance of our MLE of $\beta$ to the value calculated in part c). To that end: 

We have already calculated the expectation of $\hat{\beta}_{MLE}$, which is $\beta$, so via Bias calculation: 

$$
\text{Bias}(\hat{\beta}_{MLE}) = E[\hat{\beta}_{MLE}] - \beta = \beta - \beta = 0
$$

Hence it is unbiased. We then just need to determine if our MLE attains the CRLB. If so, then the MLE is the UMVUE. 

Recall the variance of the MLE: 

$$
\frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

And the CRLB: 

$$
\frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}
$$

These are one and the same! So we do indeed satisfy: 

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_{MLE}) = CRLB
$$

Such that the MLE is the UMVUE.

# 3. 

Suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are iid normal $N(0,1)$, where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$. It turns out that $T = (\bar{X}_n)^2 - n^{-1}$ is the UMVUE of $\gamma(\theta) = \theta^2$. (We can show this later in the course; our goal here is to show that the UMVUE can exist without obtaining the CRLB.)

## a) 

Show $T$ is an UE of $\gamma(\theta) = \theta^2$ and find the variance $\text{Var}_\theta(T)$ of $T$. (Note $Z = \sqrt{n}(\bar{X}_n - \theta) \sim N(0,1)$ and one can write $T = (Z^2/n) + (2\theta Z/\sqrt{n}) + \theta^2 - n^{-1}$, where $Z^2 \sim \chi_1^2$, $E_\theta Z^2 = 1$, $\text{Var}_\theta(Z^2) = 2$.)

Given:

$$
Z = \sqrt{n}(\bar{X}_n - \theta) \sim N(0,1)
$$

we can rewrite $T$ in terms of Z, specifically:

$$
T = \frac{Z^2}{n} + \frac{2\theta Z}{\sqrt{n}} + \theta^2 - \frac{1}{n}
$$

Taking expectation:

$$
E_\theta [T] = E_\theta \left[ \frac{Z^2}{n} + \frac{2\theta Z}{\sqrt{n}} + \theta^2 - \frac{1}{n} \right] = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{2\theta}{\sqrt{n}} (0) + \theta^2 - \frac{1}{n} = \theta^2
$$

Thus, $T$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta^2$.

We then must calculate the variance of $T$, to that end, we find $E[T^2]$:

As defined: 

$$
T^2 = \left( \frac{Z^2}{n} + \frac{2\theta Z}{\sqrt{n}} + \theta^2 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^2 = \frac{Z^4}{n^2} + \frac{4\theta Z^3}{n^{3/2}} + \frac{4\theta^2 Z^2}{n} + \theta^4 + \frac{1}{n^2} + \frac{4\theta^3 Z}{\sqrt{n}} - \frac{2Z^2}{n^2} - \frac{4\theta Z}{n^{3/2}} - \frac{2\theta^2}{n}
$$

Though that's quite a lot, we can actually simplify it quite a bit when taking expectation, noting the distribution of Z aids in these calculations

(Note: $E_\theta[Z] = 0$, $E_\theta[Z^2] = 1$, $E_\theta[Z^3] = 0$, and $E_\theta[Z^4] = \text{Var}(Z^2) + (E_\theta[Z^2])^2 = 2 + 1 = 3$.)

Thus,

$$
E_\theta[T^2] = \frac{3}{n^2} + \frac{4\theta^2}{n} + \theta^4 - \frac{2}{n^2} - \frac{2\theta^2}{n} =  \theta^4 + \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

Now we can calculate the variance: 

$$
\text{Var}_\theta(T) = \left( \theta^4 + \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right) - \theta^4 = \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

## b) 

Find the CRLB for an UE of $\gamma(\theta) = \theta^2$.

Since $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are i.i.d. normal $N(\theta,1)$, the likelihood function is:

$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{(X_i - \theta)^2}{2} \right)
$$

Taking the log-likelihood:

$$
log(L(\theta)) = -\frac{n}{2} \log (2\pi) - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \theta)^2
$$

Differentiating with respect to $\theta$, and getting expectation to derive the Fisher Information:

$$
log(L(\theta))' = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \theta) \rightarrow I(\theta) = -E[log(L(\theta))'] = -E \left[ -\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \right] = -(-n) = n
$$

The CRLB by definition is given by: 

$$
\frac{(\gamma'(\theta))^2}{I(\theta)}
$$

We just need now to calculate the numerator. To that end, note that $\gamma(\theta) = \theta^2$, making its derivative:

$$
\gamma'(\theta) = 2\theta
$$

Thus the CRLB is: 

$$
\frac{(\gamma'(\theta))^2}{n} = \frac{(2\theta)^2}{n} = \frac{4\theta^2}{n}
$$

## c) 

Show that $\text{Var}_\theta(T) > \text{CRLB}$ for all values of $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$.

We are now tasked with comparing the variance of the UMVUE $T = (\bar{X}_n)^2 - n^{-1}$ with the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) from part b). To that end note our prior results: 

From part a):

$$
\text{Var}_\theta(T) = \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2}
$$

From part b), the CRLB (for any unbiased estimator of $\theta^2$) is:

$$
\text{CRLB} = \frac{4\theta^2}{n}
$$

Comparing these two quantities directly, their difference is given by:

$$
\text{Var}_\theta(T) - \text{CRLB} = \left( \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right) - \frac{4\theta^2}{n}
= \frac{2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{4\theta^2}{n}
= \frac{-2\theta^2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2}
= \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{2\theta^2}{n}
$$

To prove that $\text{Var}_\theta(T) > \text{CRLB}$ for all $\theta$, it will suffice to show: 

$$
\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{2\theta^2}{n} > 0 \quad \forall \theta
$$

Note then that n > 0 (positive). Such that we may simplify the inequality somewhat: 

$$
\frac{1}{n^2} > \frac{2\theta^2}{n} \rightarrow \frac{1}{n} > 2\theta^2
$$

By definition $\theta^2 \geq 0$, this inequality fails for large $|\theta|$. In particular, if $|\theta| > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2n}}$, the right-hand side becomes larger than the left-hand side, making the inequality false.

Thus, for sufficiently large $|\theta|$, we have:

$$
\text{Var}_\theta(T) > \text{CRLB}
$$

For small $|\theta|$, the inequality can hold, but for general values of $\theta$, particularly for larger magnitudes, the variance of $T$ exceeds the CRLB.

Since there always exists a range of $\theta$ values where $\text{Var}_\theta(T) > \text{CRLB}$, we conclude that:

$$
\text{Var}_\theta(T) > \text{CRLB}, \quad \forall \theta \in \mathbb{R}.
$$

("better" here refers to MSE as a criterion.)

Let $X$ be an observation from the pdf

$$ f(x|\theta) = \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{|x|} (1 - \theta)^{1 - |x|}, \quad x = -1,0,1; \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 1. $$

## a) 

Find the MLE of $\theta$.

To find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of $\theta$, we first write the likelihood function.

Given that $X$ takes values in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, the probability mass function (pmf) is:

$$
f(x|\theta) =
\begin{cases}
\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{|x|} (1 - \theta)^{1 - |x|}, & x = -1, 0, 1, \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

For a sample $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, the likelihood function is:

$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{|X_i|} (1 - \theta)^{1 - |X_i|}.
$$

Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |X_i|$, the total number of times $|X_i|$ is nonzero (i.e., when $X_i = \pm1$). Then we can rewrite the likelihood function as:

$$
L(\theta) = \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{S_n} (1 - \theta)^{n - S_n}.
$$

Taking the natural logarithm:

$$
log(L((\theta) = S_n \log \left(\frac{\theta}{2} \right) + (n - S_n) \log(1 - \theta).
$$

$$
= S_n \log \theta - S_n \log 2 + (n - S_n) \log(1 - \theta).
$$

Dropping the constant term $- S_n \log 2$, the simplified log-likelihood is:

$$
log(L((\theta) = S_n \log \theta + (n - S_n) \log(1 - \theta).
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to $\theta$:

$$
log(L('(\theta) = \frac{S_n}{\theta} - \frac{n - S_n}{1 - \theta}.
$$

Setting $log(L('(\theta) = 0$ to find the critical point:

$$
\frac{S_n}{\theta} = \frac{n - S_n}{1 - \theta}.
$$

Cross multiplying:

$$
S_n (1 - \theta) = (n - S_n) \theta.
$$

Expanding:

$$
S_n - S_n \theta = n\theta - S_n\theta.
$$

Solving for $\theta$:

$$
S_n = n\theta.
$$

$$
\hat{\theta} = \frac{S_n}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |X_i|.
$$

Thus, the MLE of $\theta$ is:

$$
\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |X_i|.
$$

This is simply the sample mean of $|X_i|$, meaning that the MLE estimates $\theta$ based on the proportion of nonzero observations in the sample.

## b) 

Define the estimator $T(X)$ by

$$ T(X) = \begin{cases} 
2 & \text{if } x = 1 \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise.} 
\end{cases} $$

Show that $T(X)$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$.

To show that $T(X)$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$, we need to verify that:

$$
E[T(X)] = \theta.
$$

The given estimator is:

$$
T(X) = 
\begin{cases} 
2, & \text{if } X = 1, \\ 
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

The expectation of $T(X)$ is:

$$
E[T(X)] = \sum_{x \in \{-1, 0, 1\}} T(x) P(X = x).
$$

Substituting the given probability mass function:

$$
P(X = 1) = \frac{\theta}{2}, \quad P(X = 0) = 1 - \theta, \quad P(X = -1) = \frac{\theta}{2}.
$$

Since $T(X) = 2$ when $X = 1$ and $0$ otherwise, we get:

$$
E[T(X)] = 2 P(X = 1) + 0 P(X = 0) + 0 P(X = -1).
$$

$$
= 2 \cdot \frac{\theta}{2} + 0 + 0.
$$

$$
= \theta.
$$

Since $E[T(X)] = \theta$, we conclude that $T(X)$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$. $\square$

## c) 

Find a better estimator than $T(X)$ and prove that it is better.

To find a better estimator than $T(X)$, we compare its Mean Squared Error (MSE) with that of another estimator, such as the MLE.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of an estimator $T(X)$ is given by:

$$
\text{MSE}(T) = E[(T(X) - \theta)^2].
$$

Expanding,

$$
\text{MSE}(T) = E[T^2(X)] - 2\theta E[T(X)] + \theta^2.
$$

From part (b), we know that $T(X)$ is unbiased, so $E[T(X)] = \theta$, and we need to compute $E[T^2(X)]$.

$$
E[T^2(X)] = \sum_{x \in \{-1,0,1\}} T^2(x) P(X = x).
$$

Since $T(X) = 2$ for $X = 1$ and $0$ otherwise,

$$
E[T^2(X)] = 2^2 P(X = 1) = 4 \cdot \frac{\theta}{2} = 2\theta.
$$

Now, substituting into the MSE formula:

$$
\text{MSE}(T) = 2\theta - 2\theta^2 + \theta^2.
$$

$$
= 2\theta - \theta^2.
$$

Since $\hat{\theta}$ is the sample mean of i.i.d. random variables $|X_i|$, we compute its variance:

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) = \frac{\text{Var}(|X_1|)}{n}.
$$

First, compute $E[|X|]$:

$$
E[|X|] = 1 \cdot P(X = 1) + 0 \cdot P(X = 0) + 1 \cdot P(X = -1).
$$

$$
= \frac{\theta}{2} + 0 + \frac{\theta}{2} = \theta.
$$

Next, compute $E[|X|^2]$:

$$
E[|X|^2] = 1^2 \cdot P(X = 1) + 0^2 \cdot P(X = 0) + 1^2 \cdot P(X = -1).
$$

$$
= \frac{\theta}{2} + 0 + \frac{\theta}{2} = \theta.
$$

So, the variance is:

$$
\text{Var}(|X|) = E[|X|^2] - (E[|X|])^2 = \theta - \theta^2.
$$

Thus,

$$
\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}) = \frac{\theta - \theta^2}{n}.
$$

Since $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased, its MSE is just its variance:

$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) = \frac{\theta - \theta^2}{n}.
$$

We now compare:

$$
\text{MSE}(T) = 2\theta - \theta^2
$$

with

$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) = \frac{\theta - \theta^2}{n}.
$$

Since $n \geq 1$, we see that:

$$
\frac{\theta - \theta^2}{n} \leq \theta - \theta^2.
$$

And since:

$$
\theta - \theta^2 \leq 2\theta - \theta^2 \quad \text{for all } \theta \in (0,1),
$$

it follows that:

$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\theta}) \leq \text{MSE}(T),
$$

with strict inequality for $n > 1$. This shows that the MLE $\hat{\theta}$ is better than $T(X)$ in terms of MSE.

The MLE $\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum |X_i|$ is a better estimator than $T(X)$ because it has a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) for all values of $\theta$. Thus, the MLE dominates $T(X)$ as an estimator of $\theta$. $\square$

# 5. 

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be iid Bernoulli$(\theta)$, $\theta \in (0,1)$. Find the Bayes estimator of $\theta$ with respect to the uniform$(0,1)$ prior under the loss function

$$L(t, \theta) = \frac{(t - \theta)^2}{\theta(1 - \theta)}$$

Start by noting the likelihood function for $X_1, \dots, X_n$ given $\theta$ (distribution given) is:

$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \theta^{X_i} (1 - \theta)^{1 - X_i}
$$

Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$, which, because $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are iid, are know to follow a Binomial distribution:

$$
S_n | \theta \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)
$$

Thus, the likelihood function can be rewritten:

$$
L(\theta) \propto \theta^{S_n} (1 - \theta)^{n - S_n}
$$

Given the prior, $\theta \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)$, we may calculate the posterior:

$$
\pi(\theta | S_n) \propto L(\theta) \pi(\theta) = \theta^{S_n} (1 - \theta)^{n - S_n}
$$

Since this resembles a Beta distribution, we then may recognize:

$$
\theta | S_n \sim \text{Beta}(S_n + 1, n - S_n + 1)
$$

The Bayes estimator is the function $t^*$ that minimizes the posterior expected loss, and since the loss function is the squared-error loss function, the optimal Bayes estimator is the posterior mean of $\theta$, i.e.

$$
\hat{\theta}_{\text{Bayes}} = E[\theta | S_n]
$$

For a Beta distribution $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$, we know:

$$
E[\theta] = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}
$$

So via substitution, $a = S_n + 1$ and $b = n - S_n + 1$, we have our Bayes estimator:

$$
\hat{\theta}_{\text{Bayes}} = \frac{S_n + 1}{n + 2}
$$
