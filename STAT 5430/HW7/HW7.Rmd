# Q1 

Problem 8.6 a) - b), Casella and Berger (2nd Edition)

Suppose that we have two independent random samples: $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are exponential$(\theta)$, and $Y_1, \ldots, Y_m$ are exponential$(\mu)$.

## a) 

Find the LRT of

$$
H_0: \theta = \mu \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \theta \ne \mu.
$$

### Answer

## b) 

Show that the test in part a) can be based on the statistic

$$
T = \frac{\sum X_i}{\sum X_i + \sum Y_i}.
$$

# Q2 

Problem 8.28, Casella and Berger (2nd Edition)

Let $f(x|\theta)$ be the logistic location probability density function:

$$
f(x|\theta) = \frac{e^{(x - \theta)}}{(1 + e^{(x - \theta)})^2}, \quad -\infty < x < \infty, \quad -\infty < \theta < \infty.
$$

## a) 

Show that this family has an MLR. 

### Answer

## b) 

Based on one observation $X$, find the most powerful size $\alpha$ test of

$$
H_0: \theta = 0 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \theta = 1.
$$

For $\alpha = 0.2$, find the size of the Type II error.

### Answer 

## c) 

Show that the test in part b) is UMP size $\alpha$ for testing

$$
H_0: \theta \leq 0 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \theta > 0.
$$

What can be said about UMP tests in general for the logistic location family?

# Q3 

Problem 8.29 a) - b), Casella and Berger (2nd Edition)

Let $X$ be one observation from a Cauchy$(\theta)$ distribution.

The Cauchy$(\theta)$ density is given by:

$$
f(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + (x - \theta)^2}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}, -\infty < \theta < \infty.
$$

## a)

Show that this family does not have an MLR.

### Hint: 

Show that the Cauchy$(\theta)$ family $\{ f(x|\theta) : \theta \in \mathbb{R} = \Theta \}$, based on one observation $X$, does not have monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) in $t(X) = X$ or $t(X) = -X$. That is, the ratio

$$
\frac{f(x|\theta_2)}{f(x|\theta_1)}
$$

might not be monotone (either increasing or decreasing) in $x$.

### Answer 

## b)

Show that the test

$$
\phi(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } 1 < x < 3 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

is most powerful of its size for testing

$$
H_0 : \theta = 0 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1 : \theta = 1.
$$

Calculate the Type I and Type II error probabilities.

### Hint: 

Show that the test given is equivalent to rejecting $H_0$ if

$$
f(x|\theta = 1) > 2f(x|\theta = 0)
$$

and not rejecting otherwise. Conclude that this must be the most powerful (MP) test for its size. Justify why.

### Answer 

\newpage

## Q4

Consider one observation $X$ from the probability density function

$$
f(x|\theta) = 1 - \theta^2 \left( x - \frac{1}{2} \right), \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1,\quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 1.
$$

We wish to test:

$$
H_0: \theta = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \theta > 0
$$

## a)

Find the UMP test of size $\alpha = 0.05$ based on $X$. Carefully justify your answer.

### Answer 

## b)

Find the likelihood ratio test statistic $\lambda(X)$ based on $X$, expressed as a function of $X$.

### Answer

## c)

Find the likelihood ratio test (LRT) of size $\alpha = 0.05$ for the above hypotheses.
