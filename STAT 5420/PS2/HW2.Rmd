\[
1 = \int\limits_{\infty}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}x^2 e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}dx} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}{x^2 e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}dx}

>> Q: Suppose a random variable X has the following cdf from class (which is neither a step function nor continuous):  

\[
F(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  1 & x < 0 \\
  1 & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\ 
  0 & x > 1
\end{cases}
\]

(a): Find the following probabilities: 
  $P(X > \frac{1}{2})$
  $P(X \geq \frac{1}{2})$
  $P(0 < X \leq \frac{1}{2})$
  $P(0 \leq X \leq \frac{1}{2})$

(b): Conditional on the event "X > 0", the corresponding conditional pdf of X (i.e. given X > 0) is as follows at $x \in \mathbb{R}$: 

\[
P(X \leq x | X > 0 ) = \frac{P(X \leq x , X > 0 )}{P(X > 0)} = \frac{P(0 < X \leq x)}{P(X > 0)} = \frac{F(x) - F(0)}{1 - F(0)}
\]

Giving: 

\[
P(X \leq x | X > 0 ) = 
\begin{cases}
  0 & x \leq 0 \\
  x & 0 < x \leq 1 \\ 
  1 & x > 1
\end{cases}
\]

Based on the conditional cdf above, show that the distribution of X, conditional on "X > 0", is the same (i.e. has the same cdf) as that of a random variable Y which is "uniform" on the interval (0, 1), having constant pdf $f_Y(y) = 1$ for $0 < y < 1$ (with $f_Y(y) = 0$ for all other $y \in \mathbb{R}$)

>> Q: Statistical reliability involves studying the time to failure of manufactured units. In many reliability textbooks, one can find the exponential distribution: 

\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{\theta} e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}} & x > 0 \\
  0 & x \leq 0
\end{cases}
\]

where $\theta > 0$ is a fixed value, for modeling the time X that a random unit runs until failure (i.e. X is a survival time). Show that if X has an exponential distribution as above, then: 

$P(X > s + t | X > t) = P(X > s)$

for any values t, s > 0; this feature is called the "memoryless" property of te exponential distribution.

>> Q: Suppose X has the Geometrc pmf: 
$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{2}{3})^x$, $x = 0, 1, 2, ...$
Determine the probability distribution of $Y = \frac{X}{X+1}$
Note that here X and Y are discrete random variables. To specify the probability distribution of Y, specify its pmf.

>> Q: 
Let $\lambda$ be a fixed positive constant, and define the function $f(x)$ by: 
$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ if $x \geq 0$ 
and $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\lambda e^{\lambda x}$ if $x < 0$

>> Q: Suppose that a random variable U has a Uniform(0,1) distribution 

(i.e. pdf $f_U(u) = 1$ for 0 < u < 1)

(a): Suppose a random variable Xhas a cdf $F(x)$ which is strictly increasing and continuous on $x \in \mathbb{R}$; this implies that, for any real value of 0 < u < 1, there is an inverse $F^{-1}(u) = x \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $F(x) = F(F^{-1}(u)) = u$. Define a random variable $Y = F^{-1}(U)$ based on the random variable U. Show that X and Y have the same cdf (i.e. the same distributions).

Hint: Use that, because F is strictly increasing, $P(Y \leq y) = P(F(Y) \leq F(y))$ holds for any $y \in \mathbb{R}$, i.e., Y can be less than or equal to y if and only if F(Y) is less than or equal to $F(y)$. Noe that $F(y) \in (0, 1)$ for any real y. 

(b): If there is a computer program (i.e. random number generator) that produces numbers uniformly distributed between zero and one (i.e., according to the pdf $F_U(u)$), explain how these numbers could be  used to generate values distributed according to the pdf $f_Z(z) = \frac{e^{-|z|}}{2}$, $-\infty < z < \infty$. 

Hint: Use (a) where F now becomes the cdf of Z; you need to find $F^{-1}(u)$ for a given 0 < u < 1 by solving the expression $F(z) = u$ for $z \in \mathbb{R}$
