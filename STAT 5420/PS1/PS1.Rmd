> 1. 1.12 (a) 

> 2. 1.13: If $P(A) = \frac{1}{3}$ and $P(B^{c}) = \frac{1}{4}$, can A and B be disjoint?

A: 

> 3. 

Suppose a family has 4 children, named a, b, c and d, who take turns washing 4 plates denoted $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$. These children are not so careful in their work, so, over time, each of the plates will be broken. Suppose any child could break any plate and that the ways in which plates $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$ could be broken by children a, b, c, d are equally likely. 

(a) Find the probability that child a breaks 3 plates. 


(b) Find the probability that one of the four children breaks 3 plates. 


> 4. 1.34 

Two litters of a particular rodent species have been born, one with two brown-haired and one gray-haired (litter 1), and the other with three brown-haired and two gray-haired (litter 2). We select a litter at random and then select an  offspring at random from the selected litter. 

(a) What is the probability that the animal chosen is brown-haired? 


(b) Give that a brown-haired offspring was selected, what is the probability that the sampling was from litter 1? 


> 5. 1.38 

Prove each of the following statements. (Assume that any conditioning event has positive probability.)

(a) If $P(B) = 1$, then $P(A|B) = P(A)$ for any A. 


(b) If $A \subset B$, then $P(B|A) = 1$ and $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$

(c) If A and B aremutually exclusive, then: 

$P(A | A  \cup B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}$

(d) $P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A | B \cup C) P(B | C)P(C)$

> 6. 1.39 

A pair of events A and B cannot be simultaneously mutually exclusive and independent. Prove that $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$ then: 

(a) 

If A and B are mutually exclusive, they cannot be independent. 


(b)

If A and B are independent, they cannot be mutually exclusive.
