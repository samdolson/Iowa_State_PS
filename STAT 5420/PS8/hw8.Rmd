# Q1 

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be independent exponential random variables with mean $\theta$.

## (a) 

Find the joint moment generating function of $X_1$ and $X_2$.

## (b) 

Give the definition of the moment generating function of $X_1 - X_2$ and show how this can be obtained from part (a).

## (c) 

Find the distribution of $Y = X_1 - X_2$. Using the mgf, one can find that this is a so-called Laplace or double-exponential distribution.

# Q2: 4.30, Casella & Berger

Suppose the distribution of $Y$, conditional on $X = x$, is $N(x, x^2)$ and that the marginal distribution of $X$ is uniform $(0, 1)$.

## (a) 

Find $E[Y]$, $\text{Var}[Y]$, and $\text{Cov}(X, Y)$.

## (b) 

Prove that $\frac{Y}{X}$ and $X$ are independent.

# Q3: 4.54, Casella & Berger

Find the pdf of $\prod_{i=1}^n X_i$, where the $X_i$'s are independent uniform $(0, 1)$ random variables.

*(Hint: Try to calculate the cdf, and remember the relationship between uniforms and exponentials.)*

\newpage

# Q4: 4.47, Casella & Berger

*(Marginal normality does not imply bivariate normality.)* 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $N(0,1)$ random variables, and define a new random variable $Z$ by

$$
Z = 
\begin{cases} 
X & \text{if } XY > 0, \\
-X & \text{if } XY < 0.
\end{cases}
$$

## (a) 

Show that $Z$ has a normal distribution.

## (b) 

Show that the joint distribution of $Z$ and $Y$ is not bivariate normal. *(Hint: Show that $$Z$$ and $$Y$$ always have the same sign.)*

# Q5: 4.52, Casella & Berger 

Bullets are fired at the origin of an $(x, y)$ coordinate system, and the point hit, say $(X, Y)$, is a random variable. The variables $X$ and $Y$ are taken to be independent $N(0, 1)$ random variables. If two bullets are fired independently, what is the distribution of the distance between them?

\newpage

# Q6: 4.55, Casella & Berger

A **parallel system** is one that functions as long as at least one component of it functions. 

A particular parallel system is composed of three independent components, each of which has a lifetime with an exponential $(\lambda)$ distribution. The lifetime of the system is the maximum of the individual lifetimes. 

What is the distribution of the lifetime of the system?

\newpage

# Q7: 4.28, Casella & Berger

Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent standard normal random variables.

## (a) 

Show that $\frac{X}{X + Y}$ has a Cauchy distribution.

## (b) 

Find the distribution of $\frac{X}{|Y|}$.

## (c) 

Is the answer to part (b) surprising? Can you formulate a general theorem?

\newpage

# Q8: 4.50, Casella & Berger

If $(X, Y)$ has the bivariate normal probability density function (pdf):

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi(1-\rho^2)^{1/2}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)} \left( x^2 - 2\rho xy + y^2 \right) \right),
$$

show that 

$$
\text{Corr}(X, Y) = \rho
$$ 

and 

$$
\text{Corr}(X^2, Y^2) = \rho^2.
$$ 

*Hint:* Conditional expectations will simplify calculations.
