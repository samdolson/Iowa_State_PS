## Question 2
A family continues to have children until they have one female child. Suppose, for each birth, a single child is born and the child is equally likely to be male or female. The gender outcomes are independent across births. 
(a): Let X be a random variable representing the number of children born to this family. Find the distribution of X. 

(b): Find the expected value $E(X)$

(c): Let $X_m$ denote the number of male children in this family and let $X_f$ denote the number of female children. Find the expected value of $X_m$ and the expected value of $X_f$

## Question 5
Suppose that X has the standard normal distribution with pdf: 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}$$, $-\infty < x < \infty$

Then the random variable Y, $Y=e^{X}$ has a log-normal distribution. 

(a): Find $E(Y^r)$ for any r. 

(b): Show the moment generating function of Y does not exist (even though all moments of Y exist).

## Question 6 
Suppose that X has a normal distribution with pdf: 

$$f(x) \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^22}}$$, $-\infty < x < \infty$

The mean of X is $\mu$. Show that the moment generating function of X satisfies $M_X(t) \geq e^{t\mu}$

## Question 7
Suppose that $X$ has pmf $f(x) = p(1-p)^{x-1}$, for $x = 1, 2, 3, ...$ where $0<p<1$. Find the mgf $M_X(t)$ and use this to derive the mean and variance of X.

## Question 8
Suppose for one month a company purfchases c copies of a software package at a cost of $d_1$ dollars per copy. The packages are sold to customers for $d_2$ dollars per copy; any unsold copies are destroyed at the end of the month. Let $X$ represent the demand for this software package in the month. Assume that $X$ is a discrete random variable with pmf $f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$. 

(a): Let $s = \text{min} \{ X, c\}$ represent the number of sales during the month. Show that:

$$E(S) = \sum\limits_{x=0}^{c} xf(x) + c(1-F(c))$$

(b): Let $Y = S * d_2 - cd_1$ represent the profit for the company, the total income from sales minus the total cost of all copies. Find $E(Y)$

(c): As $Y \equiv Y_c$ depends on integer $c \geq 0$, write the expected profit function as $g(c) \equiv E(Y_c)$ from part (b). The company should choose the value of c which maximizes $g(c)$; that is, choose the smallest c such that $g(c+1)$ is less than or equal to $g(c)$. Show that such $c \geq 0$ is the smallest integer with $F(c) \geq \frac{d_2 - d_1}{d_2}$
