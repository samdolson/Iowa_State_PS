## Question 2
A family continues to have children until they have one female child. Suppose, for each birth, a single child is born and the child is equally likely to be male or female. The gender outcomes are independent across births. 
(a): Let X be a random variable representing the number of children born to this family. Find the distribution of X. 

(b): Find the expected value $E(X)$

(c): Let $X_m$ denote the number of male children in this family and let $X_f$ denote the number of female children. Find the expected value of $X_m$ and the expected value of $X_f$
