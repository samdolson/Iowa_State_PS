# Homework 4 - Theory Notes

## Q7 
To solve for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) such that \(P(|X| < 2) = \frac{1}{2}\) where \(X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)\), we can express the probability in terms of the standard normal variable \(Z\).

Recall that \(X\) can be standardized as follows:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1).
\]

The condition \( |X| < 2 \) can be rewritten as:

\[
-2 < X < 2.
\]

This translates to:

\[
P(-2 < X < 2) = P\left(\frac{-2 - \mu}{\sigma} < Z < \frac{2 - \mu}{\sigma}\right).
\]

Let:

\[
a = \frac{-2 - \mu}{\sigma} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{2 - \mu}{\sigma}.
\]

Thus, we need to find:

\[
P(a < Z < b) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, we have:

\[
P(a < Z < b) = \Phi(b) - \Phi(a) = \frac{1}{2},
\]

where \(\Phi\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.

This equation can be rewritten as:

\[
\Phi(b) = \Phi(a) + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Next, we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\):

\[
b = a + d,
\]

where \(d\) represents the distance in standard deviations that corresponds to \(\frac{1}{2}\) probability in the standard normal distribution.

From the properties of the standard normal distribution, we know that if \(a\) and \(b\) are such that:

\[
\Phi(b) = \Phi(a) + \frac{1}{2},
\]

then there exists a specific relationship between \(a\) and \(b\). By defining \(d\) appropriately, we find that the values are constrained by:

\[
b = a + d.
\]

Given the symmetry of the normal distribution, we can let:

1. Set \(a = -z\) and \(b = z\).
2. Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\Phi(z) - \Phi(-z) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Using the symmetry of the normal distribution:

\[
\Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z),
\]

we find:

\[
\Phi(z) - (1 - \Phi(z)) = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 2\Phi(z) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \Phi(z) = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

From standard normal distribution tables, we can find \(z\) such that:

\[
\Phi(z) = \frac{3}{4} \implies z \approx 0.674.
\]

Therefore:

\[
a = \frac{-2 - \mu}{\sigma} = -z \implies \frac{-2 - \mu}{\sigma} = -0.674 \implies -2 - \mu = -0.674\sigma \implies \mu = -2 + 0.674\sigma,
\]

and 

\[
b = \frac{2 - \mu}{\sigma} = z \implies \frac{2 - \mu}{\sigma} = 0.674 \implies 2 - \mu = 0.674\sigma \implies \mu = 2 - 0.674\sigma.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\mu\) equal to each other:

\[
-2 + 0.674\sigma = 2 - 0.674\sigma,
\]

solving for \(\sigma\):

\[
0.674\sigma + 0.674\sigma = 4 \implies 1.348\sigma = 4 \implies \sigma = \frac{4}{1.348} \approx 2.96.
\]

Substituting back to find \(\mu\):

\[
\mu = -2 + 0.674 \cdot 2.96 \approx -2 + 2.0 \approx 0.
\]

Thus, the values are:

\[
\mu \approx 0, \quad \sigma \approx 2.96.
\]

**Uniqueness:**

To check the uniqueness, consider the functions \( \Phi(b) - \Phi(a) \) as continuous functions of \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \). The conditions specified yield a unique pair \((\mu, \sigma)\) as long as \(\sigma > 0\) since each probability corresponds to a unique interval in the normal distribution. Thus, the solution is indeed unique:

\[
\mu = 0, \quad \sigma \approx 2.96 \text{ (to satisfy } P(|X| < 2) = \frac{1}{2}).
\]
